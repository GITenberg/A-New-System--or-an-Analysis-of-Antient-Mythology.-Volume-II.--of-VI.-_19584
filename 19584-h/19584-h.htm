  <p>As there has been much uncertainty about the purport and extent of
  these terms; and they are of great consequence in the course of history;
  I will endeavour to state their true meaning. Phoinic, or Poinic, was an
  Egyptian and Canaanitish term of honour; from whence were formed <span
  title="Phoinix, Phoinikes, Phoinikoeis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BE;,
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>
  of the Greeks, and Phoinic, Poinicus, Poinicius of the Romans; which were
  afterwards changed to Ph&#339;nix, Punicus, and <a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>Puniceus. It was originally a title,
  which the Greeks made use of as a provincial name: but it was never
  admitted as such by the people, to whom it was thus appropriated, till
  the Greeks were in possession of the country. And even then it was but
  partially received: for though mention is made of the coast of
  Ph&#339;nice, yet we find the natives called Sidonians, Tyrians, and <a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>Canaanites, as
  late as the days of the Apostles. It was an honorary term, compounded of
  Anac with the Egyptian prefix; and rendered at times both Phoinic and
  Poinic. It signified a lord or prince: and was particularly assumed by
  the sons of Chus and Canaan. The Mysians seem to have kept nearest to the
  original pronunciation, who gave this title to the God Dionusus, and
  called him Ph'anac.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>Ogygia me Bacchum vocat,</p>
      <p>Osirin Ægyptus putat,</p>
      <p>Mysi Phanacem.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was also conferred upon many things, which were esteemed princely
  and noble. Hence the red, or scarlet, a colour appropriated to great and
  honourable personages, was styled Phoinic. The palm was also styled
  Phoinic, <span title="Phoinix" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BE;</span>: and the antients
  always speak of it as a stately and noble tree. It was esteemed an emblem
  of honour; and made use of as a reward of victory. Plurimarum palmarum
  homo, was a proverbial expression among the Romans, for a soldier of
  merit. Pliny speaks of the various species of palms; and of the great
  repute in which they were held by the Babylonians. He says, that the
  noblest of them were styled the royal Palms; and supposes that they were
  so called from their being set apart for the king's use. But they were
  very early an emblem of royalty: and it is a circumstance included in
  their original name. We find from Apuleius, that Mercury, the <a
  name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>Hermes of Egypt,
  was represented with a palm branch in his hand: and his priests at
  Hermopolis used to have them stuck in their <a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>sandals, on the outside. The Goddess
  <a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>Isis was thus
  represented: and we may infer that Hermes had the like ornaments; which
  the Greeks mistook for feathers, and have in consequence of it added
  wings to his feet. The Jews used to carry boughs of the same tree at some
  of their festivals; and particularly at the celebration of their
  nuptials: and it was thought to have an influence at the birth. Euripides
  alludes to this in his Ion; where he makes Latona recline herself against
  a Palm tree, when she is going to produce Apollo and Diana.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In how great estimation this tree was held of old, we may learn from
  many passages in the sacred writings. Solomon says to his espoused, <a
  name="footnotetag8" href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><i>how fair and
  how pleasant art thou, O Love, for delights: thy stature is like a Palm
  tree</i>. And the Psalmist for an encouragement to holiness, says, <a
  name="footnotetag9" href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><i>that the
  righteous shall flourish like the Palm tree</i>: for the Palm was
  supposed to rise under a weight; and to thrive in proportion to its being
  <a name="footnotetag10" href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>depressed.
  There is possibly a farther allusion in this, than may at first appear.
  The antients had an opinion, that the Palm was immortal: at least, if it
  did die, it recovered again, and obtained a second life by renewal. Hence
  the story of the bird, styled the Phoenix, is thought to have been
  borrowed from this tree. Pliny, in describing the species of Palm, styled
  Syagrus, says, <a name="footnotetag11"
  href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>Mirum de eâ accepimus, cum
  Ph&#339;nice Ave, quæ putatur ex hujus Palmæ argumento nomen accepisse,
  iterum mori, et renasci ex seipsà. Hence we find it to have been an
  emblem of immortality among all nations, sacred and prophane. The blessed
  in heaven are represented in the Apocalypse by St. John, <a
  name="footnotetag12" href="#footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>as standing
  before the throne in white robes, with branches of Palm in their hands.
  The notion of this plant being an emblem of royalty prevailed so far,
  that when our Saviour made his last entrance into Jerusalem, the people
  took branches of Palm trees, and accosted him as a prince, crying, <a
  name="footnotetag13"
  href="#footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a><i>Hosanna&mdash;blessed is the
  King of Israel</i>.</p>

  <p>The title of Phoinic seems at first to have been given to persons of
  great stature: but, in process of time, it was conferred upon people of
  power and eminence, like <span title="anax" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;</span> and <span title="anaktes" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span> among the
  Greeks. The Cuthites in Egypt were styled Royal Shepherds, <span
  title="Basileis Poimenes" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;
  &#x3A0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, and had
  therefore the title of Ph&#339;nices. A colony of them went from thence
  to Tyre and Syria: hence it is said by many writers that Ph&#339;nix came
  from Egypt to Tyre. People, not considering this, have been led to look
  for the shepherd's origin in Canaan, because they were sometimes called
  Ph&#339;nices. They might as well have looked for them in Greece; for
  they were equally styled <a name="footnotetag14"
  href="#footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a><span title="Hellênes" class="grk"
  >&#x1F19;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, Hellenes.
  Ph&#339;nicia, which the Greeks called <span title="Phoinikê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>, was but a
  small part of Canaan. It was properly a slip of sea coast, which lay
  within the jurisdiction of the Tyrians and Sidonians, and signifies Ora
  Regia; or, according to the language of the country, the coast of the
  Anakim. It was a lordly title, and derived from a stately and august
  people. All the natives of Canaan seem to have assumed to themselves
  great honour. The Philistines are spoken of as <a name="footnotetag15"
  href="#footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>Lords, and the merchants of Tyre as
  Princes; whose grandeur and magnificence are often alluded to in the
  Scriptures. The prophet Ezekiel calls them the princes of the sea. <a
  name="footnotetag16" href="#footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a><i>Then all
  the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away
  their robes, and put off their broidered garments.</i> And Isaiah speaks
  to the same purpose. <a name="footnotetag17"
  href="#footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a><i>Who hath taken this counsel
  against Tyre, that crowning city, whose merchants are princes; whose
  traffickers are the honourable of the earth?</i> The scripture term by
  which they are here distinguished is <span lang="he" title="SHRIM" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E9;&#x5E8;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;</bdo></span>, Sarim: but the title
  which they assumed to themselves was Ph'anac, or Ph'oinac, the
  Ph&#339;nix of the Greeks and Romans. And as it was a mere title, the
  sacred writers of the old testament never make use of it to distinguish
  either the people or country. This part of Canaan is never by them called
  Ph&#339;nicia: yet others did call it so; and the natives were styled
  Ph&#339;nices before the birth of Homer. But this was through mistake;
  for it was never used by the natives as a provincial appellation. I have
  shewn that it was a title of another sort, a mark of rank and
  pre-eminence: on this account it was assumed by other people, and
  conferred upon other places. For this reason it is never mentioned by any
  of the sacred writers before the captivity, in order to avoid ambiguity.
  The Gentile writers made use of it; and we see what mistakes have ensued.
  There were Ph&#339;nicians of various countries. They were to be found
  upon the Sinus <a name="footnotetag18"
  href="#footnote18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>Persicus, upon the Sinus <a
  name="footnotetag19" href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>Arabicus, in
  Egypt, in <a name="footnotetag20"
  href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>Crete, in <a name="footnotetag21"
  href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>Africa, in <a name="footnotetag22"
  href="#footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>Epirus, and even in Attica. <a
  name="footnotetag23" href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a><span
  title="Phoinikes&mdash;genos ti Athênêisi" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;&mdash;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;

  <i>There is a race of people called Ph&#339;nicians</i> <i>among the <a

  In short, it was a title introduced at Sidon, and the coast adjoining, by
  people from Egypt: and who the people were that brought it may be known
  from several passages in antient history; but particularly from an
  extract in Eusebius, <a name="footnotetag25"

  <i>Ph&#339;nix and Cadmus, retiring from Thebes, in Egypt, towards the
  coast of Syria, settled at Tyre and Sidon, and reigned there.</i> It is
  said, that <a name="footnotetag26"
  href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>Belus carried a colony to the same
  parts: and from what part of the world <a name="footnotetag27"
  href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>Belus must be supposed to have
  come, needs not to be explained. Euripides styles Cepheus the king of
  Ethiopia, the son of Ph&#339;nix: and Apollodorus makes him the son of
  Belus: hence we may infer, that Belus and Ph&#339;nix were the same. Not
  that there were any such persons as Ph&#339;nix and Belus, for they were
  certainly titles: and, under the characters of those two personages,
  Colonies, named Belidæ and Ph&#339;nices, went abroad, and settled in
  different parts. Their history and appellation may be traced from
  Babylonia to Arabia and Egypt; and from thence to Canaan, and to the
  regions in the west. It were therefore to be wished, that the terms
  Ph&#339;nix and Ph&#339;nicia had never been used in the common
  acceptation; at least when the discourse turns upon the more antient
  history of Canaan. When the Greeks got possession of the coast of Tyre,
  they called it Ph&#339;nicia: and from that time it may be admitted as a
  provincial name. In consequence of this, the writers of the New Testament
  do not scruple to make use of it, but always with a proper limitation;
  for the geography of the Scriptures is wonderfully exact. But the Greek
  and Roman writers often speak of it with a greater latitude, and include
  Judea and Palestina within its borders; and sometimes add Syria and
  Idume. But these countries were all separate and distinct; among which
  Ph&#339;nicia bore but a small proportion. Yet, small as it may have
  been, many learned men have thought, that all the colonies, which at
  times settled upon the coast of the Mediterranean, were from this
  quarter; and that all science was of Ph&#339;nician original. But this is
  not true according to their acceptation of the term. Colonies did settle;
  and science came from the east: but not merely from the Sidonian. I shall
  shew, that it was principally owing to a prior and superior branch of the
  family.</p>

<h3>COHEN, <span lang="he" title="KHN" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5D4;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, OF THE HEBREWS.</h3>

  <p>I have before taken notice that the term Cahen denoted a Priest, or
  President; and that it was a title often conferred upon princes and
  kings. Nor was it confined to men only: we find it frequently annexed to
  the names of Deities, to signify their rule and superintendency over the
  earth. From them it was derived to their attendants, and to all persons
  of a prophetical or sacred character. The meaning of the term was so
  obvious, that one would imagine no mistake could have ensued: yet such is
  the perverseness of human wit, that we find it by the Greeks and Romans
  constantly misapplied. They could not help imagining, from the sound of
  the word, which approached nearly to that of <span title="kuôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span> and canis, that it had some
  reference to that animal: and, in consequence of this unlucky
  resemblance, they continually misconstrued it <i>a dog</i>. Hence we are
  told by <a name="footnotetag37"
  href="#footnote37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>Ælian and <a name="footnotetag38"
  href="#footnote38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>Plutarch, not only of the great
  veneration paid to dogs in Egypt, and of their being maintained in many
  cities and temples; in which they certainly exceed the truth; but we are
  moreover assured, that the people of Ethiopia had a dog for their king:
  that he was kept in great state, being surrounded with a numerous body of
  officers and guards, and in all respects royally treated. Plutarch speaks
  of him as being <a name="footnotetag39"

  worshipped with a degree of religious reverence. The whole of this notion
  took its rise from a misinterpretation of the title above. I have
  mentioned, that in early times Cahen was a title universally conferred
  upon priests and prophets: hence Lycophron, who has continually allusions
  to obsolete terms, calls the two diviners, Mopsus and Amphilochus, <span

  prophets of Apollo.</i> Upon this the learned <a name="footnotetag41"
  href="#footnote41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>Meursius observes, that Lycophron
  had here made use of a term imported from Egypt: so that, I think, we
  cannot be mistaken about the purport of the word, however it may have
  been perverted.</p>

  <p>The name of the Deity, Canouphis, expressed also Canuphis, and
  Cnuphis, was compounded with this term. He was represented by the
  Egyptians as a princely person, with a serpent entwined round his middle,
  and embellished with other characteristics, relating to time and
  duration, of which the serpent was an emblem. Oph, and Ouph, signified a
  serpent in the Amonian language; and the Deity was termed Can-uph, from
  his serpentine representation. The whole species, in consequence of this,
  were made sacred to him, and styled Canyphian. To this Lucan alludes,
  when, in speaking of the Seps, he calls all the tribe of serpents
  Cinyphias pestes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p><a name="footnotetag42"
  href="#footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>Cinyphias inter pestes tibi palma
  nocendi.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Canuphis was sometimes expressed Anuphis and Anubis; and, however
  rendered, was by the Greeks and Romans continually spoken of as a dog; at
  least they supposed him to have had a dog's head, and often mention his
  <a name="footnotetag43" href="#footnote43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>barking.
  But they were misled by the title, which they did not understand. The
  Egyptians had many emblematical personages, set off with heads of various
  animals, to represent particular virtues and affections, as well as to
  denote the various attributes of their Gods. Among others was this canine
  figure, which I have no reason to think was appropriated to Canuph, or
  Cneph. And though upon gems and marbles his name may be sometimes found
  annexed to this character, yet it must be looked upon as a Grecian work,
  and so denominated in consequence of their mistaken notion. For we must
  make a material distinction between the hieroglyphics of old, when Egypt
  was under her own kings; and those of later date, when that country was
  under the government of the Greeks: at which time their learning was
  greatly impaired, and their antient theology ruined. Horus Apollo assures
  us, if any credit may be given to what he says, that this canine figure
  was an emblem of the earth: <a name="footnotetag44"
  href="#footnote44"><sup>[44]</sup></a><span title="Oikoumenên graphontes kunokephalon zôgraphousi." class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;
  &#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B6;&#x3C9;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;.</span>
  <i>When they would describe the earth, they paint a Cunocephalus.</i> It
  could not, therefore, I should think, in any degree relate to Canuphis.
  The same<a name="footnotetag45" href="#footnote45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
  writer informs us, that under the figure of a dog they represented a
  priest, or sacred scribe, and a prophet; and all such as had the chief
  management of funerals: also the spleen, the smell, sneezing; rule and
  government, and a magistrate, or judge: which is a circumstance hardly to
  be believed. For, as hieroglyphics were designed to distinguish, it is
  scarce credible that the Egyptians should crowd together so many
  different and opposite ideas under one character, whence nothing could
  well ensue but doubt and confusion. Besides, I do not remember, that in
  any group of antient hieroglyphics the figure of a dog occurs. The
  meaning of this history, I think, may be with a little attention made
  out. The Egyptians were refined in their superstitions, above all the
  nations in the world; and conferred the names and titles of their Deities
  upon vegetables and animals of every species; and not only upon these,
  but also upon the parts of the human body, and the very passions of the
  mind. Whatever they deemed salutary, or of great value, they
  distinguished by the title of Sacred, and consecrated it to some <a
  name="footnotetag46" href="#footnote46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>God. This will
  appear from words borrowed from Egypt. The Laurel, Laurus, was
  denominated from Al-Orus: the berry was termed bacca, from Bacchus;
  Myrrh, <span title="Murrha" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3C5;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3B1;</span> was from Ham-Ourah; Casia,
  from Chus. The Crocodile was called Caimin and Campsa; the Lion, El-Eon;
  the Wolf, El-Uc; the Cat, Al-Ourah: whence the Greeks formed <span
  title="leôn, lukos, ailouros" class="grk">&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;,
  &#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. The
  Egyptians styled Myrrh, Baal; balsam, baal-samen; Camphire, Cham-phour,
  <span title="kamphoura" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span> of
  Greece; Opium, Ophion. The sweet reed of Egypt was named <a
  name="footnotetag47" href="#footnote47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>Canah, and
  Conah, by way of eminence; also, <a name="footnotetag48"
  href="#footnote48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>Can-Osiris. Cinnamon was
  denominated from Chan-Amon; Cinnabar, <span title="kinnabaris" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  from Chan-Abor; the sacred beetle, Cantharus, from Chan-Athur. The harp
  was styled Cinnor, and was supposed to have been found out by Cinaras;
  which terms are compounded of Chan-Or, and Chan-Arez; and relate to the
  Sun, or Apollo, the supposed inventor of the lyre. Priests and
  magistrates were particularly honoured with the additional title of
  Cahen; and many things held sacred were liable to have it in their
  composition. Hence arose the error of Horus Apollo; who, having been
  informed that the antient Egyptians distinguished many things which were
  esteemed holy by this sacred title, referred the whole to hieroglyphics,
  and gave out that they were all represented under the figure of a dog.
  And it is possible, that in later times the Grecian artists, and the
  mixed tribes of Egypt, may have expressed them in this manner; for they
  were led by the ear; and did not inquire into the latent purport of the
  <a name="footnotetag49" href="#footnote49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>theology
  transmitted to them. From hence we may perceive how little, in later
  times, even the native Egyptians knew of their rites and history.</p>

  <p>Farther accounts may be produced from the same writer, in confirmation
  of what I have been saying. He not only mentions the great veneration
  paid by the Egyptians to dogs, but adds, that in many temples they kept
  <span title="kunokephaloi" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>,
  a kind of baboons, or animals with heads like those of dogs, which were
  wonderfully endowed. By their assistance the Egyptians found out the
  particular periods of the Sun and Moon. These did not, like other
  animals, die at once, but by piece-meal; so that one half of the animal
  was oftentimes buried, while the other half<a name="footnotetag50"
  href="#footnote50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> survived. He moreover assures us,
  that they could read and write; and whenever one of them was introduced
  into the sacred apartments for probation, the priest presented him with a
  <a name="footnotetag51" href="#footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>tablet, and
  with a pen and ink; and by his writing could immediately find out if he
  were of the true intelligent breed. These animals are said to have been
  of infinite use to the antient Egyptians in determining times and
  seasons; for it seems they were, in some particular functions, the most
  accurate and punctual of any creatures upon earth: <a
  name="footnotetag52" href="#footnote52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>Per æquinoctia
  enim duodecies in die urinam reddere, et in nocte<a name="footnotetag53"
  href="#footnote53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> compertus (Cunocephalus), æquali
  interstitio servato, Trismegisto ansam dedit diem dividendi in duodecim
  partes æquales. Such is the history of these wonderful <a
  name="footnotetag54" href="#footnote54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>animals. That
  Apes and Baboons were, among the Egyptians, held in veneration, is very
  certain. The Ape was sacred to the God Apis; and by the Greeks was
  rendered Capis, and <a name="footnotetag55"
  href="#footnote55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>Ceipis. The Baboon was denominated
  from the Deity<a name="footnotetag56"
  href="#footnote56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Babon, to whom it was equally
  sacred. But what have these to do with the supposed Cunocephalus, which,
  according to the Grecian interpretation, is an animal with the head of a
  dog? This characteristic does not properly belong to any species of Apes,
  but seems to have been unduly appropriated to them. The term
  Cunocephalus, <span title="Kunokephalos" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  is an Egyptian compound: and this strange history relates to the priests
  of the country, styled Cahen; also to the novices in their temples; and
  to the examinations, which they were obliged to undergo, before they
  could be admitted to the priesthood. To explain this, I must take notice,
  that in early times they built their temples upon eminences, for many
  reasons; but especially for the sake of celestial observations. The
  Egyptians were much addicted to the study of astronomy: and they used to
  found their colleges in Upper Egypt upon rocks and hills, called by them
  Caph. These, as they were sacred to the Sun, were farther denominated
  Caph-El, and sometimes Caph-Aur, and Caph-Arez. The term Caph-El, which
  often occurs in history, the Greeks uniformly changed to <span
  title="Kephalê" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>, Cephale: and from
  Cahen-Caph-El, the sacred rock of Orus, they formed <span
  title="Kunokephalê" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>,
  and <span title="Kunokephalos" class="grk"

  which they supposed to relate to an animal with the head of a dog. But
  this Cahen-Caph-El was certainly some royal seminary in Upper Egypt,
  whence they drafted novices to supply their colleges and temples. These
  young persons were, before their introduction, examined by some superior
  priest; and, accordingly as they answered upon their trial, they were
  admitted, or refused. They were denominated Caph-El, and Cahen-Caph-El,
  from the academy where they received their first instruction; and this
  place, though sacred, seems to have been of a class subordinate to
  others. It was a kind of inferior cloister and temple, such as Capella in
  the Romish church; which, as well as Capellanus, was derived from Egypt:
  for, the church, in its first decline, borrowed largely from that
  country. That there was some particular place of this sort situated upon
  a rock or eminence, may, I think, be proved from Martianus Capella; and,
  moreover, that it was a seminary well known, where the youth of Upper
  Egypt were educated. For, in describing the sciences, under different
  personages, he gives this remarkable account of Dialectica upon
  introducing her before his audience. <a name="footnotetag57"
  href="#footnote57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>Hæc se educatam dicebat in
  <i>Ægyptiorum Rupe;</i> atque in Parmenidis exinde gymnasium, atque
  Atticam demeasse. And Johannes Sarisburiensis seems to intimate that
  Parmenides obtained his knowledge from the same quarter, when he mentions
  <a name="footnotetag58" href="#footnote58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>"<i>in
  Rupe</i> vitam egisse. In this short detail we have no unpleasing account
  of the birth of science in Egypt, and of its progress thence to Attica.
  It is plain that this Rupes Ægyptiaca could be nothing else but a
  seminary, either the same, or at least similar to that, which I have
  before been describing. As the Cunocephali are said to have been sacred
  to Hermes, this college and temple were probably in the nome of
  Hermopolis. Hermes was the patron of Science, and particularly styled
  Cahen, or <a name="footnotetag59"
  href="#footnote59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>Canis: and the Cunocephali are said
  to have been worshipped by the people of that <a name="footnotetag60"
  href="#footnote60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>place. They were certainly there
  reverenced: and this history points out very plainly the particular spot
  alluded to. Hermopolis was in the upper region styled Thebaïs: and there
  was in this district a tower, such as has been <a name="footnotetag61"
  href="#footnote61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>mentioned. It was in aftertimes
  made use of for a repository, where they laid up the tribute. This may
  have been the Rupes Ægyptiaca, so famed of old for science; and which was
  the seat of the Chancephalim, or Cunocephalians.</p>

  <p>It is said of the Cunocephali, that when one part was dead and buried,
  the other still survived. This can relate to nothing else but a society,
  or body politic, where there is a continual decrement, yet part still
  remains; and the whole is kept up by succession. It is an enigma, which
  particularly relates to the priesthood in Egypt: for the sacred office
  there was hereditary, being vested in certain families; and when part was
  dead, a residue still <a name="footnotetag62"
  href="#footnote62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>survived, who admitted others in
  the room of the deceased. <a name="footnotetag63"
  href="#footnote63"><sup>[63]</sup></a><span title="Epean de tis apothanêi, toutou ho pais antikatistatai." class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD; &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;

  The sons, we find, supplied the place of their fathers: hence the body
  itself never became extinct, being kept up by a regular succession. As to
  the Cunocephali giving to Hermes the first hint of dividing the day into
  twelve parts from the exactness, which was observed in their <a
  name="footnotetag64" href="#footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>evacuations,
  it is a surmise almost too trifling to be discussed. I have shewn that
  the Cunocephali were a sacred college, whose members were persons of
  great learning: and their society seems to have been a very antient
  institution. They were particularly addicted to astronomical
  observations; and by contemplating the heavens, styled Ouran, they
  learned to distinguish the seasons, and to divide the day into parts. But
  the term Ouran the Greeks by a strange misconception changed to <span
  title="ourein" class="grk"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>; of which mistake they
  have afforded other instances: and from this abuse of terms the silly
  figment took its rise.</p>

  <p>The Cunocephali are not to be found in Egypt only, but in India
  likewise; and in other parts of the world. Herodotus <a
  name="footnotetag65" href="#footnote65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>mentions a
  nation of this name in Libya: and speaks of them as a race of men with
  the heads of dogs. Hard by in the neighbourhood of this people he places
  the <span title="Akephaloi" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, men
  with no heads at all: to whom, out of humanity, and to obviate some very
  natural distresses, he gives eyes in the breast. But he seems to have
  forgot mouth and ears, and makes no mention of a nose: he only says, <a
  name="footnotetag66" href="#footnote66"><sup>[66]</sup></a><span
  title="Akephaloi, hoi en stêthesin ophthalmous echontes." class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;,
  &#x1F41;&#x3B9; &#x3B5;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;.</span> Both these and
  the Cunocephali were denominated from their place of residence, and from
  their worship: the one from Cahen-Caph-El, the other from Ac-Caph-El:
  each of which appellations is of the same purport, the right noble, or
  sacred <a name="footnotetag67" href="#footnote67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>rock
  of the Sun.</p>

  <p>Similar to the history of the Cunocephali, and Acephali, is that of
  the Cunodontes. They are a people mentioned by Solinus and Isidorus, and
  by them are supposed to have had the teeth of dogs. Yet they were
  probably denominated, like those above, from the object of their worship,
  the Deity Chan-Adon; which the Greeks expressed <span title="Kunodôn" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, and styled his
  votaries <a name="footnotetag68"
  href="#footnote68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>Cunodontes.</p>

  <p>The Greeks pretended, that they had the use of the sphere, and were
  acquainted with the zodiac, and its asterisms very early. But it is plain
  from their mistakes, that they received the knowledge of these things
  very late; at a time when the terms were obsolete, and the true purport
  of them not to be obtained. They borrowed all the schemes under which the
  stars are comprehended from the Egyptians: who had formed them of old,
  and named them from circumstances in their own religion and mythology.
  They had particularly conferred the titles of their Deities upon those
  stars, which appeared the brightest in their hemisphere. One of the most
  remarkable and brilliant they called Cahen Sehor; another they termed
  Purcahen; a third Cahen Ourah, or Cun Ourah. These were all misconstrued,
  and changed by the Greeks; Cahen-Sehor to Canis Sirius; P'urcahen to
  Procyon; and Cahen Ourah to Cunosoura, the dog's tail. In respect to this
  last name I think, from the application of it in other instances, we may
  be assured that it could not be in acceptation what the Greeks would
  persuade us: nor had it any relation to a dog. There was the summit of a
  hill in Arcadia of this <a name="footnotetag69"
  href="#footnote69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>name: also a promontory in <a
  name="footnotetag70" href="#footnote70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>Attica; and
  another in <a name="footnotetag71"
  href="#footnote71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>Eub&#339;a. How could it possibly
  in its common acceptation be applicable to these places? And as a
  constellation if it signified a dog's tail, how came it to be a name
  given to the tail of a bear? It was a term brought from <a
  name="footnotetag72" href="#footnote72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>Sidon, and
  Egypt: and the purport was to be sought for from the language of the
  Amonians.</p>

  <p>The antient Helladians used upon every promontory to raise pillars and
  altars to the God of light, Can-Our, the Chan-Orus of Egypt. But Can-Our,
  and Can-Ourah, they changed to <span title="kunosoura" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>,
  as I have shewn: yet notwithstanding this corruption, the true name is
  often to be discovered. The place which is termed Cunosoura by Lucian, in
  his Icaromemenippus, is called Cunoura by Stephanus Byzant, and by <a
  name="footnotetag73" href="#footnote73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>Pausanias.
  Cunoura is also used by Lycophron, who understood antient terms full
  well, for any high rock or headland.</p>

  <p>We find the same mistake occur in the account transmitted to us
  concerning the first discovery of purple. The antients very gratefully
  gave the merit of every useful and salutary invention to the Gods. Ceres
  was supposed to have discovered to men corn, and bread: Osiris shewed
  them the use of the plough; Cinyras of the harp: Vesta taught them to
  build. Every Deity was looked up to as the cause of some blessing. The
  Tyrians and Sidonians were famous for the manufacture of purple: the die
  of which was very exquisite, and the discovery of it was attributed to
  Hercules of Tyre; the same who by Palæphatus is styled Hercules <a
  name="footnotetag75" href="#footnote75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>Philosophus.
  But some will not allow him this honour; but say, that the dog of
  Hercules was the discoverer. For accidentally feeding upon the Murex,
  with which the coast abounded, the dog stained his mouth with the ichor
  of the fish; and from hence the first hint of dying was <a
  name="footnotetag76" href="#footnote76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>taken. This
  gave birth to the proverbial expression, <a name="footnotetag77"

  <p>Such is the story, which at first sight is too childish to admit of
  credit. It is not likely that a dog would feed upon shell-fish: and if
  this may at any time have happened, yet whoever is at all conversant in
  natural history, must know, that the murex is of the turbinated kind, and
  particularly aculeated; having strong and sharp protuberances, with which
  a dog would hardly engage. The story is founded upon the same
  misconception, of which so many instances have been produced. Hercules of
  Tyre, like all other oriental divinities, was styled Cahen, and Cohen; as
  was allowed by the Greeks themselves. <a name="footnotetag79"

  are told, that Hercules in the language of the Egyptians is called

  changed this sacred title to <a name="footnotetag80"
  href="#footnote80"><sup>[80]</sup></a><span title="kuôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, a dog, which they described as an
  attendant upon the Deity.</p>

  <p>The Grecians tell us, that the Egyptians styled Hermes a dog: but they
  seem to have been aware, that they were guilty of an undue
  representation. Hence Plutarch tries to soften, and qualify what is
  mentioned, by saying, <a name="footnotetag81"
  href="#footnote81"><sup>[81]</sup></a><span title="Ou gar kuriôs ton Hermên KYNA legousin (hoi Aiguptioi)" class="grk"

  &#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;)</span>:
  by which this learned writer would insinuate, that it was not so much the
  name of a dog, as the qualities of that animal, to which the Egyptians
  alluded. Plutarch thought by this refinement to take off the impropriety
  of conferring so base a name upon a Deity. But the truth is, that the
  Egyptians neither bestowed it nominally; nor alluded to it in any degree.
  The title which they gave to Hermes was the same that they bestowed upon
  Hercules: they expressed it Cahen, and Cohen; and it was very properly
  represented above by the Greek term <span title="Chôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, Chon. It is said of Socrates, that he
  sometimes made use of an uncommon oath, <span title="ma ton kuna, kai ton chêna" class="grk"
  >&#x3BC;&#x3B1; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span> <i>by the dog and the goose</i>:
  which at first does not seem consistent with the gravity of his
  character. But we are informed by Porphyry, that this was not done by way
  of ridicule: for Socrates esteemed it a very serious and religious mode
  of attestation: and under these terms made a solemn appeal to the son of
  <a name="footnotetag82" href="#footnote82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>Zeus. The
  purport of the words is obvious: and whatever hidden meaning there may
  have been, the oath was made ridiculous by the absurdity of the terms.
  Besides, what possible connection could there have subsisted between a
  dog and a Deity; a goose and the son of Jove? There was certainly none:
  yet Socrates, like the rest of his fraternity, having an antipathy to
  foreign terms, chose to represent his ideas through this false medium; by
  which means the very essence of his invocation was lost. The son of Zeus,
  to whom he appealed, was the Egyptian Cahen abovementioned; but this
  sacred title was idly changed to <span title="kuna kai chêna" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>, a dog and a goose, from a similitude
  in sound. That he referred to the Egyptian Deity, is manifest from Plato,
  who acknowledges that he swore, <a name="footnotetag83"
  href="#footnote83"><sup>[83]</sup></a><span title="ma ton kuna ton Aiguptiôn theon" class="grk"

  &#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. By which we are to understand a
  Cahen of Egypt. Porphyry expressly says, that it was the God Hermes the
  son of Zeus, and Maia: <a name="footnotetag84"

  <p>I cannot account upon any other principle than that upon which I have
  proceeded, for the strange representation of Apollo, and Bacchus, gaping
  with open mouths. So it seems they were in some places described. Clemens
  of Alexandria mentions from Polemon, that Apollo was thus exhibited: <a
  name="footnotetag85" href="#footnote85"><sup>[85]</sup></a><span
  title="Polemôn de kechênotos Apollônos oiden agalma" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; &#x3B4;&#x3B5;

  &#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span>. And we are told that a
  gaping<a name="footnotetag86" href="#footnote86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>
  Bacchus was particularly worshipped at Samos. They were both the same as
  the Egyptian Orus; who was styled Cahen-On, Rex, vel Deus Sol; out of
  which Cahen-On the Grecians seem to have formed the word <span
  title="Chainôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>: and in consequence of
  it, these two Deities were represented with their jaws widely extended.
  This term was sometimes changed to <span title="koinos" class="grk"

  Grecians themselves the term <span title="koinos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> was an antient title
  of eminence. <a name="footnotetag89"
  href="#footnote89"><sup>[89]</sup></a><span title="Koinos, ho Despotês" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;, &#x1F41;
  &#x394;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>.
  <i>Coinos signifies a lord and master</i>: undoubtedly from Cohinus; and
  that from Cohen. It would be endless to enumerate all the instances which
  might be brought of this nature. Of this, I think, I am assured, that
  whoever will consider the uncouth names both of Deities, and men, as well
  as of places, in the light recommended; and attend to the mythology
  transmitted concerning them; will be able by these helps to trace them to
  their original meaning. It is, I think, plain, that what the Grecians so
  often interpreted <span title="kunes" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, was an antient Amonian
  title. When therefore I read of the brazen dog of Vulcan, of the dog of
  Erigone, of Orion, of Geryon, of Orus, of Hercules, of Amphilochus, of
  Hecate, I cannot but suppose, that they were the titles of so many
  Deities; or else of their priests, who were denominated from their
  office. In short, the Cahen of Egypt were no more dogs than the Pateræ of
  Amon were basons: and though Diodorus does say, that at the grand
  celebrity of <a name="footnotetag90"
  href="#footnote90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>Isis, the whole was preceded by
  dogs, yet I cannot help being persuaded that they were the priests of the
  Goddess.</p>

  <p>By this clue we may unravel many intricate histories transmitted from
  different parts. In the temple of Vulcan, near mount Ætna, there are said
  to have been a breed of dogs, which fawned upon good men, but were
  implacable to the bad. <a name="footnotetag91"
  href="#footnote91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>Inde etiam perpetuus ignis a
  Siculis alebatur in Ætnæo Vulcani templo, cui custodes adhibiti sunt
  sacri canes, blandientes piis hominibus, in impios ferocientes. In the
  celebrated gardens of Electra there was a golden dog, which shewed the
  same regard to good men, and was as inveterate to others.</p>

  <p>All this relates to the Cusean priests of Vulcan or Hephaistos, and to
  the priesthood established in his temple: which priesthood was kept up by
  succession, and never became extinct. What was Cusean, the Greeks often
  rendered <span title="Chruseion" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, as I
  shall hereafter shew. The same people were also styled Cuthim; and this
  word likewise among the antients signified gold: from hence these priests
  were styled <span title="Chruseioi kunes" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>. We find the like history in
  Crete: here too was a golden dog, which Zeus had appointed to be the
  guardian of his temple<a name="footnotetag95"
  href="#footnote95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>. By comparing these histories, I
  think we cannot fail of arriving at the latent meaning. The God of light
  among other titles was styled Cahen, or Chan-Ades: but the term being
  taken in the same acceptation here, as in the instances above, the Deity
  was changed to a dog, and said to reside in the infernal regions. From
  hence he was supposed to have been dragged to light by Hercules of
  Thebes. The notion both of Cerberus and Hades being subterraneous Deities
  took its rise from the temples of old being situated near vast caverns,
  which were esteemed passages to the realms below. Such were in Messenia,
  in Argolis, in Bithynia, and at Enna in Sicily; not to mention divers
  other places. These temples were often named Kir-Abor; and the Deity
  Chan-Ades; out of which terms the Greeks formed <span title="Ton Kerberon kuna hadou" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x39A;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B2;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1; &#x1F01;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>; and
  fabled, that he was forced into upper air by Hercules, through these
  infernal inlets. And as temples similar in name and situation were built
  in various parts, the like history was told of them all. Pausanias takes
  notice of this event, among other places, being ascribed to the cavern at
  <a name="footnotetag96" href="#footnote96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>Tænarus; as
  well as to one at <a name="footnotetag97"
  href="#footnote97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>Tr&#339;zen, and to a third near
  the city <a name="footnotetag98"
  href="#footnote98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>Hermione. The Poet Dionysius speaks
  of the feat being performed in the country of the Marianduni, near
  Colchis.</p>

  <p>But however the Deity in all these <ins class="correction"
  title="'intances' in original">instances</ins> may have been degraded to

  title="Kun-hadês" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;-&#x1F01;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>; and such was
  the purport of that name. He was the same as Apollo, as may be proved
  from the Cunidæ at Athens, who were a family set apart for his service.
  <span title="Kunnidai, genos Athênêisin, ex hou ho hiereus tou Kunniou Apollônos." class="grk"

  Hesychius. <i>The Cunnidai are a family at Athens, out of which the
  priest of Apollo Cunnius is chosen</i>. He styles him Apollo Cunnius: but
  the Cunidai were more properly denominated from Apollo Cunides, the same
  as Cun-Ades. Poseidon was expressly styled Cun-Ades; and he was the same
  Deity as Apollo, only under a different title, as I have shewn. <span

  <i>Poseidon was worshipped at Athens under the title of Cun-Ades.</i></p>

  <p>Though I have endeavoured to shew, that the term of which I have been
  treating was greatly misapplied, in being so uniformly referred to dogs,
  yet I do not mean to insinuate that it did not sometimes relate to them.
  They were distinguished by this sacred title, and were held in some
  degree of <a name="footnotetag100"
  href="#footnote100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>veneration; but how far they were
  reverenced is not easy to determine. Herodotus,<a name="footnotetag101"
  href="#footnote101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> speaking of the sanctity of some
  animals in Egypt, says, that the people in every family, where a dog
  died, shaved themselves all over: and he mentions it as a custom still
  subsisting in his own time. Plutarch<a name="footnotetag102"
  href="#footnote102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> differs from him. He allows that
  these animals were, at one time, esteemed holy; but it was before the
  time of Cambyses: from the æra of his reign they were held in another
  light: for when this king killed the sacred Apis, the dogs fed so
  liberally upon his entrails, without making a proper distinction, that
  they lost all their sanctity. It is of little consequence whichever
  account be the truest. They were certainly of old looked upon as sacred;
  and esteemed emblems of the Deity. And it was, perhaps, with a view to
  this, and to prevent the Israelites retaining any notion of this nature,
  that a dog was not suffered to come within the precincts of the temple at
  <a name="footnotetag103"
  href="#footnote103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>Jerusalem. In the Mosaic law, the
  price of a dog, and the hire of a harlot, are put upon the same level. <a
  name="footnotetag104" href="#footnote104"><sup>[104]</sup></a><i>Thou
  shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the
  house of the Lord thy God for any vow: for both these are an abomination
  to the Lord thy God.</i></p>

  <p>To conclude: The Dog, in Egypt, was undoubtedly called Cahen, and
  Cohen; a title by which many other animals, and even vegetables, were
  honoured, on account of their being consecrated to some Deity. The Greeks
  did not consider that this was a borrowed appellation, which belonged to
  the Gods and their Priests; and was from them extended to many things
  held sacred. Hence they have continually referred this term to one object
  only: by which means they have misrepresented many curious pieces of
  history: and a number of idle fables have been devised to the
  disparagement of all that was true.</p>

  <p>Among the different branches of the great Amonian family which spread
  themselves abroad, the sons of Chus were the most considerable, and at
  the same time the most enterprising. They got access into countries
  widely distant; where they may be traced under different denominations,
  but more particularly by their family title. This we might expect the
  Greeks to have rendered Chusos, and to have named the people <span
  title="Chusaioi" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, Chusæi. But,
  by a fatal misprision, they uniformly changed these terms to words more
  familiar to their ear, and rendered them <span title="Chrusos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, and <span
  title="Chruseios" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, as if
  they had a reference to gold. I have before mentioned the various parts
  of the world where the Amonians settled, and especially this branch of
  that family. Their most considerable colonies westward were in Iönia and
  Hellas; and about Cuma and Liguria in Italy; and upon the coast of Iberia
  in Spain. They were likewise to be found in Cyrene; and still farther in
  Mauritania, and in the islands opposite to that coast. In the north they
  were to be met with at Colchis, towards the foot of Mount Caucasus, and
  in most regions upon the coast of the Euxine sea. In the histories of
  these countries the Grecians have constantly changed Chusos, the Gentile
  name, to Chrusos, <span title="Chrusos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and Chus-Or,
  Chusorus, to <span title="Chrusôr" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>, Chrusor: and, in
  consequence of this alteration, they have introduced in their accounts of
  these places some legend about gold. Hence we read of a golden fleece at
  Colchis; golden apples at the Hesperides; at <a name="footnotetag105"
  href="#footnote105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>Tartessus, a golden cup; and, at
  Cuma, in Campania, a golden branch:</p>

  Colchis, was supposed to have abounded with gold; and the like was
  pretended of the Hermus and Pactolus in Iönia. Not only the Poets, but
  many of the graver <a name="footnotetag108"
  href="#footnote108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>historians, speak of their golden
  sands. Yet there is reason to doubt of the fact: for not one of them
  produces any good voucher for what they suppose. They do not mention any
  trade carried on, nor riches accruing from this lucky circumstance: so
  that there is no reason to think that one grain of gold was gathered from
  these celebrated streams. Among the several islands occupied by this
  people were Rhodes and Delos. In the former, the chief city is said to
  have been blessed with showers of gold. <a name="footnotetag109"

  <p>We find that the very soil and foundations of the island were golden:
  the lake floated with golden waves: the olive tree vegetated with golden
  fruit: and the river Inopus, deep as it was, swelled with gold. Homer, in
  a hymn to the same personage, represents the whole more compendiously, by
  saying, that the island was weighed down with treasure:</p>

  the Phenicians, a great benefactor to mankind; and by some supposed to

  <p>We meet with the same Chrusaor in the regions of Asia Minor,

  <p>Geryon of Spain was, according to this mythology of the poet, the son
  of Chrusaor; and Chrusaor was confessedly of Egyptian original: so that,
  whatever the fable may allude to, it must have been imported into
  B&#339;tica from Egypt by some of the sons of Chus. The Grecians borrowed
  this term, and applied it to Apollo; and from this epithet, Chrusaor, he
  was denominated the God of the golden sword. Homer accordingly styles
  him, <a name="footnotetag122"
  href="#footnote122"><sup>[122]</sup></a><span title="Apollôna Chrusaora" class="grk"

  <p>This title cannot possibly relate to the implement supposed: for it
  would be idle to style an infant the God of the golden sword. It was a
  weapon, which at no time was ascribed to him: nor do I believe, that he
  is ever represented with one either upon a gem, or a marble. He is
  described as wishing for a harp, and for a bow.</p>

  <p>These habiliments are often specified: but I do not recollect any
  mention made of a sword, nor was the term Chrusaor of Grecian
  etymology.</p>

  <p>Since then we may be assured that Chus was the person alluded to under
  the name of Chrusos, Chrubor, and Chrusaor; we need not wonder that his
  substitute Apollo is so often styled <span title="Chrusokomês" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>,

  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>:
  that the harp, called by the Amonians <a name="footnotetag127"
  href="#footnote127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> Chan-Or, and Cuth-Or, from the
  supposed inventor, should by the Grecians be denominated <span
  title="Chrusea phorminx" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3BE;</span> <a

  title="Apollônos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>:
  that so many cities, where Apollo was particularly worshipped, should be
  called Chruse, and Chrusopolis, the number of which was of no small <a
  name="footnotetag129" href="#footnote129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>amount. Nor
  is this observable in cities only, but in rivers, which were named in the
  same manner. For it was usual, in the first ages, to consecrate rivers to
  Deities, and to call them after their names. Hence many were denominated
  from Chusorus, which by the Greeks was changed to <span
  title="Chrusorrhoas" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3BF;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>;
  and from this mistake they were supposed to abound with gold. The Nile
  was called Chrusorrhoas<a name="footnotetag130"
  href="#footnote130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>, which had no pretensions to
  gold: and there was a river of this name at <a name="footnotetag131"
  href="#footnote131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>Damascus. Others too might be
  produced, none of which had any claim to that mineral. There was a stream
  Chrusorrhoas near the Amazonian city Themiscura in <a
  name="footnotetag132" href="#footnote132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>Pontus: and
  the river Pactolus was of old so called, whence probably came the notion
  of its abounding with gold. <a name="footnotetag133"
  href="#footnote133"><sup>[133]</sup></a><span title="Paktôlos potamos esti tês Ludias&mdash;&mdash;ekaleito de proteron Chrusorrhoas." class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;

  &#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3BF;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;.</span>
  It was named Chrusorrhoas first, and in aftertimes Pactolus: whence we
  may conclude, in respect to gold, that the name was not given on account
  of any such circumstance; but the notion was inferred from the name.</p>

  <p>It is apparent that this repeated mistake arose in great measure from
  the term Chusus and Chrusus being similar: whence the latter was easily
  convertible into the former; which to the Grecians appeared a more
  intelligible, and at the same time a more splendid, title. But there was
  still another obvious reason for this change. Chus was by many of the
  eastern nations expressed Cuth; and his posterity the Cuthim. This term,
  in the antient Chaldäic, and other Amonian languages, signified <a
  name="footnotetag134" href="#footnote134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>gold: hence
  many cities and countries, where the Cuthites settled, were described as
  golden, and were represented by the terms Chrusos and Chruse. These, as I
  have shewn, had no relation to gold, but to Chus, who was reverenced as
  the Sun, or Apollo; and was looked upon as Dionusus; but may more truly
  be esteemed Bacchus. Hence, when the poet Dionysius mentions the island
  Chruse in <a name="footnotetag135"
  href="#footnote135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>India, his commentator observes;
  <span title="Chrusê nêsos, legomenê houtôs, ê dia to chruson pherein, ê kata ton Dionuson;" class="grk"

  <p>In a former dissertation concerning the Shepherd Kings in Egypt, I
  have shewn that they were the sons of Chus, who came into that country
  under the title of Auritæ. They settled in a province named from them
  Cushan, which was at the upper part of Delta; and in aftertimes called
  Nomos Arabicus. It was in the vicinity of Memphis, and Aphroditopolis,
  which places they likewise <a name="footnotetag137"

  Chusos was often expressed Chrusos, and the country of the Cuthim
  rendered the golden country. If then there be that uniformity in error
  which I maintain, it may be expected that, in the history of these
  places, there should be some reference to gold. It is remarkable that all

  shepherds came into Egypt, they made Memphis the seat of royal <a
  name="footnotetag139" href="#footnote139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>residence:
  and hard by was the nome of Aphrodite, and the Arabian nome, which they
  particularly possessed: and which, in consequence of it, were both styled
  the regions of the Cuthim. Hence came the title of <a
  name="footnotetag140" href="#footnote140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>Aphrodite
  Chruse: and hence the country had the name of the Golden District. The
  island at the point of Delta, where stood the city Cercusora, is called
  Gieserat <a name="footnotetag141"
  href="#footnote141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>Eddahib, or the Golden Island, at
  this day. Diodorus mentions, that this appellation of Chruse was derived
  from <i>a very antient tradition</i>. This tradition undoubtedly related
  to the shepherds, those sons of Chus, who were so long in possession of
  the country; and whose history was of the highest antiquity.</p>

  <p>The Cuthites in the west occupied only some particular spots: but from
  Babylonia eastward the greatest part of that extensive sea-coast seems to
  have been in their possession. In the history of these parts, there is
  often some allusion to gold, as may be seen in the island Chruse,
  above-mentioned; and in the Chersonesus Aurea, which lay beyond the
  Ganges: and not only of gold, but sometimes a reference to brass; and
  this from a similar mistake. For as Chusus was changed to Chrusus, <span
  title="Chrusos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, gold; so was
  Cal-Chus, the hill, or place of Chus, converted to Chalcus, <span
  title="Chalkos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, brass. Colchis was
  properly Col-Chus; and therefore called also Cuta, and Cutaia. But what
  was Colchian being sometimes rendered Chalcion, <span title="Kalkion" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, gave rise to
  the fable of brazen bulls; which were only Colchic Tor, or towers. There
  was a region named Colchis in <a name="footnotetag142"
  href="#footnote142"><sup>[142]</sup></a>India: for where the Cuthites
  settled, they continually kept up the memory of their forefathers, and
  called places by their names. This being a secret to Philostratus, has
  led him into a deal of mysterious error. It is well known that this
  people were styled Oreitæ, and Auritæ, both in Egypt and in other parts.
  Philostratus says that <a name="footnotetag143"
  href="#footnote143"><sup>[143]</sup></a>Apollonius came to a settlement
  of the Oreitæ upon the Indian Ocean. He also visited their Pegadæ; and,
  what is remarkable, he met with a people whose very rocks were brazen;
  their sand was brazen: the rivers conveyed down their streams fine
  filaments of brass: and the natives esteemed their land golden on account
  of the plenty of brass. Now what is this detail, but an abuse of terms,
  ill understood, and shamefully misapplied? Philostratus had heard of a
  region in India; the history of which he would fain render marvellous.
  The country, whither Apollonius is supposed to go, was a province of the
  Indo-Cuthites, who were to be met with in various parts under the title
  of Oreitæ. They were worshippers of fire, and came originally from the
  land of Ur; and hence had that name. The Pegadæ of the country are what
  we now call Pagodas; and which are too well known to need describing.
  There were in this part of the world several cities, and temples,
  dedicated to the memory of Chus. Some of these are famous at this day,
  though denominated after the Babylonish dialect Cutha, and Cuta; witness
  Calcutta, and Calecut. The latter seems to have been the capital of the
  region called of old Colchis. This was more truly expressed Cal-Chus;
  which Philostratus has mistaken for <span title="Chalkos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, brass; and made the
  very <a name="footnotetag144"
  href="#footnote144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>rocks and rivers abound with that
  mineral. And yet, that the old mistake about gold may not be omitted, he
  concludes with a strange antithesis, by saying, that the natives esteemed
  their country Chrusitis, or golden, from the quantity of <a
  name="footnotetag145" href="#footnote145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>brass.</p>

  <p>It has been my endeavour to prove that what the Grecians <ins
  class="correction" title="'respresented' in original">represented</ins>
  by Chrusos, Chrusor, and Chrusaor, should have been expressed Chus,
  Chusos, and Chusor, called also Chus-Orus. Chus was the son of Ham; and
  though the names of the Grecian Deities are not uniformly appropriated,
  yet Ham is generally looked upon as <span title="Helios" class="grk"
  >&#x1F19;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the Sun; and had the title
  Dis, and Dios: hence the city of Amon in Egypt was rendered Diospolis. If
  then Chrusos, and Chrusor, be, as I have supposed, Chus; the person so
  denominated must have been, according to the more antient mythology, the
  son of Helius, and Dios. We find accordingly that it was so. The
  Scholiast upon Pindar expressly says, <a name="footnotetag146"
  href="#footnote146"><sup>[146]</sup></a><span title="Dios pais ho Chrusos" class="grk"
  >&#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x1F41;
  &#x3A7;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. And in another place
  he is said to have been the offspring of Helius, who was no other than
  Cham. <a name="footnotetag147"

  are attributed to Chus, as the inventor; and they were certainly first
  practised among his sons: hence it is said by Sanchoniathon, <a
  name="footnotetag148" href="#footnote148"><sup>[148]</sup></a><span
  title="Ton Chrusôr logous askêsai kai epôidas, kai manteias" class="grk"

  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>. He was
  however esteemed a great benefactor; and many salutary inventions were
  ascribed to him. He had particularly the credit of being the first who
  ventured upon the seas: <a name="footnotetag149"
  href="#footnote149"><sup>[149]</sup></a><span title="Prôton te pantôn anthrôpôn pleusai" class="grk"

  &#x3C0;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>. Whether this
  can be said truly of Chus himself, is uncertain: it agrees full well with
  the history of his sons; who, as we have the greatest reason to be
  assured, were the first great navigators in the world.</p>

  <p>Lucian tells us, that, reflecting upon the account given of Phaëthon,
  who fell thunderstruck into the Eridanus, and of his sisters, who were
  changed to poplars weeping amber, he took a resolution, if he should ever
  be near the scene of these wonderful transactions, to inquire among the
  natives concerning the truth of the <a name="footnotetag150"
  href="#footnote150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>story. It so happened, that, at a
  certain time, he was obliged to go up the river above mentioned: and he
  says, that he looked about very wistfully; yet, to his great amazement,
  he saw neither amber nor poplar. Upon this he took the liberty to ask the
  people, who rowed him, when he should arrive at the amber-dropping trees:
  but it was with some difficulty that he could make them understand what
  he meant. He then explained to them the story of Phaëthon: how he
  borrowed the chariot of the Sun; and being an awkward charioteer, tumbled
  headlong into the Eridanus: that his sisters pined away with grief; and
  at last were transformed to trees, the same of which he had just spoken:
  and he assured them, that these trees were to be found somewhere upon the
  banks, weeping amber. Who the deuce, says one of the boatmen, could tell
  you such an idle story? We never heard of any charioteer tumbling into
  the river; nor have we, that I know of, a single poplar in the country.
  If there were any trees hereabouts dropping amber, do you think, master,
  that we would sit here, day after day, tugging against stream for a dry
  groat, when we might step ashore, and make our fortunes so easily? This
  affected Lucian a good deal: for he had formed some hopes of obtaining a
  little of this precious commodity; and began to think that he must have
  been imposed upon. However, as Cycnus, the brother of Phaëthon, was here
  changed to a swan, he took it for granted that he should find a number of
  those birds sailing up and down the stream, and making the groves echo
  with their melody. But not perceiving any in a great space, he took the
  liberty, as he passed onward, to put the question again to the boatmen;
  and to make inquiry about these birds. Pray, gentlemen, says he, at what
  particular season is it that your swans hereabouts sing so sweetly? It is
  said, that they were formerly men, and always at Apollo's side; being in
  a manner of his privy council. Their skill in music must have been very
  great: and though they have been changed into birds, they retain that
  faculty, and, I am told, sing most melodiously. The watermen could not
  help smiling at this account. Why, sir, says one of them, what strange
  stories you have picked up about our country, and this river? We have
  plied here, men and boys, for years; and to be sure we cannot say that we
  never saw a swan: there are some here and there towards the fens, which
  make a low dull noise: but as for any harmony, a rook or a jackdaw, in
  comparison of them, may be looked upon as a nightingale.</p>

  <p>Such are the witty strictures of Lucian upon the story of Phaëthon and
  Cycnus, as described by the poets. Whatever may have been the grounds
  upon which this fiction is founded, they were certainly unknown to the
  Greeks; who have misinterpreted what little came to their hands, and from
  such misconstruction devised these fables. The story, as we have it, is
  not uniformly told. Some, like Lucian, speak of swans in the plural; and
  suppose them to have been the ministers, and attendants of Apollo, who
  assisted at his concerts. Others mention one person only, called Cycnus;
  who was the reputed brother of Phaëthon, and at his death was transformed
  to the bird of that name. The fable is the same whichever way it may be
  related, and the purport of it is likewise the same. There is one mistake
  in the story, which I must set right before I proceed; as it may be of
  some consequence in the process of my inquiry. Phaëthon is represented by
  many of the poets as the offspring of the Sun, or Apollo: <a
  name="footnotetag151" href="#footnote151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>Sole satus
  Phaëthon. But this was a mistake, and to be found chiefly among the Roman
  poets. Phaëthon was the Sun. It was a title of Apollo; and was given to
  him as the God of light. This is manifest from the testimony of the more
  early Greek poets, and particularly from Homer, who uses it in this
  acceptation.</p>

  <p>In respect to Cycnus and his brotherhood, those vocal ministers of
  Apollo, the story, which is told of them, undoubtedly alludes to Canaan,
  the son of Ham; and to the Canaanites, his posterity. They sent out many
  colonies; which colonies, there is great reason to think, settled in
  those places, where these legends about swans particularly prevailed. The
  name of Canaan was by different nations greatly varied, and ill
  expressed: and this misconstruction among the Greeks gave rise to the
  fable. To shew this, it will be proper to give an account of the rites
  and customs of the Canaanites, as well as of their extensive traffic.
  Among the many branches of the Amonian family, which settled in various
  parts of the world, and carried on an early correspondence, the
  Canaanites were not the least respectable. They traded from Sidon
  chiefly, before that city was taken by the king of Ascalon: and upon
  their commerce being interrupted here, they <a name="footnotetag153"
  href="#footnote153"><sup>[153]</sup></a>removed it to the strong hold of
  Tyre. This place was soon improved to a mighty city, which was very
  memorable in its day. The Canaanites, as they were a sister tribe of the
  Mizraïm, so were they extremely like them in their rites and religion.
  They held a heifer, or cow, in high veneration, agreeably with the <a
  name="footnotetag154" href="#footnote154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>customs of
  Egypt. Their chief Deity was the Sun, whom they worshipped together with
  the Baalim, under the titles Ourchol, Adonis, Thamuz. It was a custom
  among the Grecians, at the celebration of their religious festivals, to
  crown the whole with hymns of praise, and the most joyful exclamations.
  But the Egyptians were of a gloomy turn of mind, which infected the whole
  of their worship. Their hymns were always composed in melancholy
  affecting airs, and consisted of lamentations for the loss of Osiris, the
  mystic flight of Bacchus, the wanderings of Isis, and the sufferings of
  the Gods. Apuleius takes notice of this difference in the rites and
  worship of the two nations: <a name="footnotetag155"
  href="#footnote155"><sup>[155]</sup></a>Ægyptiaca numinum fana plena

  <p>The Canaanites at Byblus, Berytus, Sidon, and afterwards at Tyre, used
  particularly mournful dirges for the loss of Adonis, or Thamuz; who was
  the same as Thamas, and Osiris in Egypt. The Cretans had the like
  mournful hymns, in which they commemorated the grief of Apollo for the
  loss of Atymnius.</p>

  <p>The measures and harmony of the Canaanites seem to have been very
  affecting, and to have made a wonderful impression on the minds of their
  audience. The infectious mode of worship prevailed so far, that the
  children of Israel were forbidden to weep, and make lamentation upon a
  festival: <a name="footnotetag158"

  &#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span> We are told by Philo from
  Sanchoniathon, that <a name="footnotetag164"
  href="#footnote164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>Isiris the Egyptian, who found
  out three letters, was the brother of Cna: by which is meant, that
  Mizraïm was the brother of Canaan. I have taken notice more than once of
  a particular term, <span title="Uk" class="grk">&#x3A5;&#x3BA;</span>,
  Uc; which has been passed over unnoticed by most writers: yet is to be
  found in the composition of many words; especially such as are of Amonian
  original. The tribe of Cush was styled by Manethon, before the passage
  was depraved, <span title="Ukkousos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. Uch,
  says this author, in the sacred language of Egypt, signifies a <a
  name="footnotetag165" href="#footnote165"><sup>[165]</sup></a>king. Hence
  it was conferred as a title upon the God Sehor, who, as we may infer from
  Manethon and <a name="footnotetag166"
  href="#footnote166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>Hellanicus, was called Ucsiris,
  and Icsiris; but by the later Greeks the name was altered to Isiris and
  Osiris. And not only the God Sehor, or Sehoris was so expressed; but
  Cnas, or Canaan, had the same title, and was styled Uc-Cnas, and the
  Gentile name or possessive was Uc-cnaos, <span title="Uk-knaos: to ethnikon gar Chnaos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA;-&#x3BA;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;: &#x3C4;&#x3BF;

  &#x3A7;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, as we learn from Stephanus.
  The Greeks, whose custom it was to reduce every foreign name to something
  similar in their own language, changed <span title="Ukknaos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> to <span
  title="Kukneios" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Uc
  Cnaus to Cucneus; and from <span title="Uk Knas" class="grk"
  >&#x3A5;&#x3BA; &#x39A;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> formed <span
  title="Kuknos" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. Some traces of this
  word still remain, though almost effaced; and may be observed in the name
  of the Goddess Ichnaia. Instead of Uc-Cnaan the son of Ham, the Greeks
  have substituted this personage in the feminine, whom they have
  represented as the daughter of the Sun. She is mentioned in this light by
  Lycophron: <a name="footnotetag167"
  href="#footnote167"><sup>[167]</sup></a><span title="Tês Hêliou thugatros Ichnaias brabeus" class="grk"

  changed Thamuz and Thamas of Canaan and Egypt to Themis a feminine; and
  called her Ichnaia Themis. She is so styled by Homer.</p>

  of <a name="footnotetag169"

  <p>There was another circumstance, which probably assisted to carry on
  the mistake: a Canaanitish temple was called both Ca-Cnas, and Cu-Cnas;
  and adjectively<a name="footnotetag170"
  href="#footnote170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> Cu-Cnaios; which terms there is
  reason to think were rendered <span title="Kuknos" class="grk"

  title="Kukneios" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. Besides
  all this, the swan was undoubtedly the insigne of Canaan, as the eagle
  and vulture were of Egypt, and the dove of Babylonia. It was certainly
  the hieroglyphic of the country. These were the causes which contributed
  to the framing many idle legends, such as the poets improved upon
  greatly. Hence it is observable, that wherever we may imagine any
  colonies from Canaan to have settled and to have founded temples, there
  is some story about swans: and the Greeks, in alluding to their hymns,
  instead of <span title="Ykknaon asma," class="grk"

  &#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;,</span> the singing of these birds: and,
  instead of the death of Thamuz, lamented by the Cucnaans, or priests,
  they have made the swans sing their own dirge, and foretell their own
  funeral. Wherever the Canaanites came, they introduced their national
  worship; part of which, as I have shewn, consisted in chanting hymns to
  the honour of their country God. He was the same as Apollo of Greece: on
  which account, Lucian, in compliance with the current notion, says, that
  the Cycni were formerly the assessors and ministers of that Deity. By
  this we are to understand, that people of this denomination were in
  antient times his priests. One part of the world, where this notion about
  swans prevailed, was in Liguria, upon the banks of the Eridanus. Here
  Phaëthon was supposed to have met with his downfal; and here his brother
  Cycnus underwent the metamorphosis, of which we have spoken. In these
  parts some Amonians settled very early; among whom it appears that there
  were many from Canaan. They may be traced by the mighty works which they
  carried on; for they drained the river towards its mouth, and formed some
  vast canals, called Fossæ Philistinæ. Pliny, speaking of the entrance
  into the Eridanus, says, <a name="footnotetag171"
  href="#footnote171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>Indé ostia plana, Carbonaria, ac
  fossiones Philistinæ, quod alii Tartarum vocant: omnia ex Philistinæ
  fossæ abundatione nascentia. These canals were, undoubtedly the work of
  the Canaanites, and particularly of some of the Caphtorim, who came from
  Philistim: and hence these outlets of the river were named Philistinæ.
  The river betrays its original in its name; for it has no relation to the
  Celtic language, but is apparently of Egyptian or Canaanitish etymology.
  This is manifest from the terms of which it is made up; for it is
  compounded of Ur-Adon, sive Orus Adonis; and was sacred to the God of
  that name. The river, simply, and out of composition, was Adon, or
  Adonis: and it is to be observed, that this is the name of one of the
  principal rivers in Canaan. It ran near the city Biblus, where the death
  of Thamuz was particularly lamented. It is a circumstance taken notice of
  by many authors, and most pathetically described by Milton.</p>

  <p>It is said that the Eridanus was so called first by <a

  Syrus: and that my etymology is true, may in great measure be proved from
  the <a name="footnotetag174"
  href="#footnote174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>Scholiast upon Aratus. He shews
  that the name was of Egyptian original, at least consonant to the
  language of Egypt; for it was the same as the Nile. It is certain that it
  occurred in the antient sphere of Egypt, whence the Grecians received it.
  The great effusion of water in the celestial sphere, which, Aratus says,
  was the Nile, is still called the Eridanus: and, as the name was of
  oriental original, the purport of it must be looked for among the people
  of those parts. The river Strymon, in Thrace, was supposed to abound with
  swans, as much as the Eridanus; and the antient name of this river was
  Palaestinus. It was so called from the Amonians, who settled here under
  the name of Adonians, and who founded the city Adonis. They were by the
  later Greeks styled, after the Iönic manner, Edonians, and their city
  Edonis. <a name="footnotetag175"

  <i>The Strymon is a river of Thrace, which runs by the city Edonis: it
  was of old called the river Palæstinus</i>. In these places, and in all
  others where any of the Canaanites settled, the Grecians have introduced
  some story about swans.</p>

  <p>Some of them seem to have gained access at Delphi; as did likewise
  others from Egypt: and by such was that oracle first founded. Egypt,

  and swans undoubtedly relate to colonies from Egypt and Canaan. I
  recollect but one philosopher styled Cygnus; and, what is remarkable, he
  was of Canaan. Antiochus, the Academic, mentioned by Cicero in his
  philosophical works, and also by <a name="footnotetag178"
  href="#footnote178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>Strabo, was of Ascaloun, in
  Palestine; and he was surnamed Cygnus, the Swan: which name, as it is so
  circumstanced, must, I think, necessarily allude to this country.</p>

  <p>As in early times colonies went by the name of the Deity whom they
  worshipped, or by the name of the insigne and hieroglyphic under which
  their country was denoted, every depredation made by such people was
  placed to the account of the Deity under such a device. This was the
  manner in which poets described things: and, in those days, all wrote in
  measure. Hence, instead of saying that the Egyptians, or Canaanites, or
  Tyrians, landed and carried off such and such persons; they said, that it
  was done by Jupiter, in the shape of an eagle, or a swan, or a bull:
  substituting an eagle for Egypt, a swan for Canaan, and a bull for the
  city of <a name="footnotetag179"
  href="#footnote179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>Tyre. It is said of the
  Telchines, who were Amonian priests, that they came to Attica under the
  conduct of Jupiter in the shape of an eagle.</p>

  <p>By which is meant, that they were Egyptian priests; and an eagle was
  probably the device in their standard, as well as the insigne of their
  nation.</p>

  <p>Some of the same family were to be found among the Atlantes of
  Mauritania, and are represented as having the shape of swans. Prometheus,
  in Æschylus, speaks of them in the commission which he gives to Io: <a
  name="footnotetag181" href="#footnote181"><sup>[181]</sup></a><i>You must
  go</i>, says he, <i>as far as the city Cisthene in the Gorgonian plains,
  where the three Phorcides reside; those antient, venerable ladies, who
  are in the shape of swans, and have but one eye, of which they make use
  in common.</i> This history relates to an Amonian temple founded in the
  extreme parts of Africa; in which there were three priestesses of
  Canaanitish race; who, on that account, are said to be in the shape of
  swans. The notion of their having but one eye among them took its rise
  from an hieroglyphic very common in Egypt, and probably in Canaan: this
  was the representation of an eye, which was said to be engraved upon the
  pediment of their <a name="footnotetag182"
  href="#footnote182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>temples. As the land of Canaan
  lay so opportunely for traffic, and the emigrants from most parts went
  under their conduct, their history was well known. They navigated the
  seas very early, and were necessarily acquainted with foreign regions; to
  which they must at one time have betaken themselves in great numbers,
  when they fled before the sons of Israel. In all the places where they
  settled they were famous for their hymns and music; all which the Greeks
  have transferred to birds, and supposed that they were swans who were
  gifted with this harmony. Yet, sweet as their notes are said to have
  been, there is not, I believe, a person upon record who was ever a
  witness to it. It is, certainly, all a fable. When, therefore, Plutarch
  tells us that Apollo was pleased with the music of swans, <a
  name="footnotetag183" href="#footnote183"><sup>[183]</sup></a><span

  &#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>; and when Æschylus
  mentions their singing their own dirges; they certainly allude to
  Egyptian and Canaanitish priests, who lamented the death of Adon and
  Osiris. And this could not be entirely a secret to the Grecians, for they
  seem often to refer to some such notion. Socrates termed swans his
  fellow-servants: in doing which he alluded to the antient priests, styled
  Cycni. They were people of the choir, and officiated in the temples of
  the same Deities; whose servant he professed himself to be. Hence
  Porphyry assures us, <a name="footnotetag184"
  href="#footnote184"><sup>[184]</sup></a><span title="Hou paizôn homodoulous autou elegen tous kuknous (Sokratês)" class="grk"

  <i>that Socrates was very serious when he mentioned swans as his
  fellow-servants.</i> When, therefore, Aristophanes speaks of the <a
  name="footnotetag185" href="#footnote185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>Delian and
  Pythian swans, they are the priests of those places, to whom he alludes.
  And when it is said by Plato, that the soul of Orpheus, out of disgust to
  womankind, led the life of a <a name="footnotetag186"
  href="#footnote186"><sup>[186]</sup></a>swan, the meaning certainly is,
  that he retired from the world to some cloister, and lived a life of
  celibacy, like a priest. For the priests of many countries, but
  particularly of Egypt, were recluses, and devoted themselves to <a
  name="footnotetag187" href="#footnote187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>celibacy:
  hence monkery came originally from Egypt. Lycophron, who was of Egypt,

  <p>The birds in the island of Diomedes, which were said to have been
  originally companions of that hero, were undoubtedly priests, and of the
  same race as those of whom I have been treating. They are represented as
  gentle to good men, and averse to those who are bad. Ovid describes their
  shape and appearance: <a name="footnotetag191"

  proxima cygnis; which, after what has been said, may, I think, be easily

  <p>If then the harmony of swans, when spoken of, not only related to
  something quite foreign, but in reality did not of itself exist, it may
  appear wonderful that the antients should so universally give into the
  notion. For not only the poets, but <a name="footnotetag192"
  href="#footnote192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>Plato, Plutarch, Cicero, Pliny,
  with many others of high rank, speak of it as a circumstance well known.
  But it is to be observed, that none of them speak from their own
  experience: nor are they by any means consistent in what they say. Some
  mention this singing as a general faculty; which was exerted at all
  times: others limit it to particular seasons, and to particular places.
  <ins class="correction" title="'Asistotle' in original">Aristotle</ins>
  seems to confine it to the seas of <a name="footnotetag193"
  href="#footnote193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>Africa: <a name="footnotetag194"
  href="#footnote194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>Aldrovandus says, that it may be
  heard upon the Thames near London. The account given by Aristotle is very
  remarkable. He says, that mariners, whose course lay through the Libyan
  sea, have often met with swans, and heard them singing in a melancholy
  strain: and upon a nearer approach, they could perceive that some of them
  were dying, from whom the harmony proceeded. Who would have expected to
  have found swans swimming in the salt sea, in the midst of the
  Mediterranean? There is nothing that a Grecian would not devise in
  support of a favourite error. The legend from beginning to end is
  groundless: and though most speak of the music of swans as exquisite; yet
  some absolutely deny <a name="footnotetag195"
  href="#footnote195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>the whole of it; and others are
  more moderate in their commendations. The watermen in Lucian give the
  preference to a jackdaw: but Antipater in some degree dissents, and
  thinks that the swan has the advantage.</p>

<h2>TEMPLE SCIENCE.</h2>

  <p>The Egyptians were very famous for geometrical knowledge: and as all
  the flat part of their country was annually overflowed, it is reasonable
  to suppose that they made use of this science to determine their lands,
  and to make out their several claims, at the retreat of the waters. Many
  indeed have thought, that the confusion of property, which must for a
  while have prevailed, gave birth to practical <a name="footnotetag199"
  href="#footnote199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>geometry, in order to remedy the
  evil: and in consequence of it, that charts and maps were first
  delineated in this country. These, we may imagine, did not relate only to
  private demesnes: but included also the course of the Nile in its various
  branches; and all the sea coast, and its inlets, with which lower Egypt
  was bounded.</p>

  <p>It is very certain, that the people of Colchis, who were a colony from
  Egypt, had charts of this sort, with written descriptions of the seas and
  shores, whithersoever they traded: and they at one time carried on a most
  extensive commerce. We are told, says the <a name="footnotetag200"
  href="#footnote200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>Scholiast upon Apollonius, that
  the Colchians still retain the laws and customs of their forefathers: and
  they have pillars of stone, upon which are engraved maps of the
  continent, and of the ocean: <span title="Eisi de, phêsi, kai nomoi par' autois tôn Progônon, kai Stêlai, en hais gês kai thalassês anagraphai eisi." class="grk"

  <p>These delineations had been made of old, and transmitted to the
  Colchians by their forefathers; which forefathers were from <a
  name="footnotetag202" href="#footnote202"><sup>[202]</sup></a>Egypt.</p>

  <p>If then the Colchians had this science, we may presume that their
  mother country possessed it in as eminent a degree: and we are assured,
  that they were very knowing in this article. Clemens Alexandrinus <a
  name="footnotetag203" href="#footnote203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>mentions,
  that there were maps of Egypt, and charts of the Nile very early. And we
  are moreover told, that Sesostris (by which is meant the Sethosians) drew
  upon boards schemes of all the countries, which he had traversed: and
  copies of these were given both to <a name="footnotetag204"
  href="#footnote204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>the Egyptians, and to the
  Scythians, who held them in high estimation. This is a curious account of
  the first delineation of countries, and origin of maps; which were first
  described upon <a name="footnotetag205"
  href="#footnote205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>pillars. We may from hence be
  enabled to solve the enigma concerning Atlas, who is said to have
  supported the heavens upon his shoulders. This took its rise from some
  verses in Homer, which have been strangely misconstrued. The passage is
  in the Odyssey; where the poet is speaking of Calypso, who is said to be
  the daughter of Atlas, <span title="oloophronos" class="grk"

  <p>It is to be observed, that when the antients speak of the feats of
  Hercules, we are to understand the Herculeans; under the name of Cadmus
  is meant the Cadmians; under that of Atlas, the Atlantians. With this
  allowance how plain are the words of Homer! The <a name="footnotetag207"
  href="#footnote207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>Atlantians settled in Phrygia and
  Mauritania; and, like the Colchians, were of the family of Ham. They had
  great experience in sea affairs: and the poet tells us, that they knew
  all the soundings in the great deep.</p>

  perfectly consonant to the truth. <i>The Herculeans were a people much
  given to divination, and to the study of nature. Great part of their
  knowledge they are thought to have had transmitted to them from those
  Atlantians, who settled in Phrygia, especially the history of the earth
  and heavens; for all such knowledge the Atlantians had of old consigned
  to pillars and obelisks in that country: and from them it was derived to
  the Herculeans, or Heraclidæ, of Greece.</i> The Atlantians were esteemed
  by the Grecians as barbarous: but they were in reality of the same
  family. Their chief ancestor was the father of the Peleiadæ, or Ionim; of
  whom I shall hereafter have much to say: and was the supposed brother of
  Saturn. The Hellenes, though they did not always allow it, were
  undoubtedly of his race. This may be proved from Diodorus Siculus, who
  gives this curious history of the Peleiadæ, his offspring. <a

  <p>Though the origin of maps may be deduced from Egypt, yet they were not
  the native Egyptians, by whom they were first constructed. Delineations
  of this nature were the contrivance of the Cuthites, or Shepherds. They
  were, among other titles, styled Saïtæ; and from them both astronomy and
  geometry were introduced in those parts. They, with immense labour,
  drained the lower provinces; erected stupendous buildings; and raised
  towers at the mouths of the river, which were opportunely situated for
  navigation. For, though the Mizraim were not addicted to commerce, yet it
  was followed by other families besides the Cuthites, who occupied the
  lower provinces towards the sea. The towers which were there raised
  served for lighthouses, and were, at the same time, temples, denominated
  from some title of the Deity, such as Canoph, Caneph, Cneph; also Perses,
  Proteus, Phanes, and Canobus. They were on both accounts much resorted to
  by mariners, and enriched with offerings. Here were deposited charts of
  the coast, and of the navigation of the Nile, which were engraved on
  pillars, and in aftertimes sketched out upon the Nilotic Papyrus. There
  is likewise reason to think that they were sometimes delineated upon
  walls. This leads me to take notice of a passage from Pherecydes Syrus,
  which seems to allude to something of this nature: though, I believe, in
  his short detail that he has misrepresented the author from whom he
  copied. He is said, by Theopompus, <a name="footnotetag212"

  assured, both by this author and by others, that the Nile was called
  Oceanus: and what is alluded to by Pherecydes is certainly a large map or
  chart. The robe of which he speaks was indeed a Pharos, <span
  title="Pharos" class="grk">&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>;
  but a Pharus of a different nature from that which he describes. It was a
  building, a temple, which was not constructed by the Deity, but dedicated
  to him. It was one of those towers of which I have before treated; in
  which were described upon the walls, and otherwise delineated, <span

  Gehon, or Nile; and the towns and houses upon that river.</p>

  <p>I imagine that the shield of Achilles, in Homer, was copied from
  something of this sort which the poet had seen in Egypt: for Homer is
  continually alluding to the customs, as well as to the history, of that
  kingdom. And, it is evident, that what he describes on the central part
  of the shield, is a map of the earth, and of the celestial
  appearances.</p>

  <p><i>He was invested with a robe, which was a type of the heavens, and a
  representation of the whole world.</i></p>

  <p>The garment of Thetis, which the poets mention as given her upon her
  supposed marriage with Peleus, was a Pharos of the same kind as that
  described above. We may learn, from Catullus, who copied the story, that
  the whole alluded to an historical picture preserved in some tower; and
  that it referred to matters of great antiquity, though applied by the
  Greeks to later times, and ascribed to people of their own nation.</p>

  <p>It contained a description of some notable achievements in the first
  ages; and a particular account of the Apotheosis of Ariadne, who is
  described, whatever may be the meaning of it, as carried by Bacchus to
  heaven. The story is said to have been painted on a robe, or coverlet;
  because it was delineated upon a Pharos: that word being equivocal, and
  to be taken in either sense. And here I cannot but take notice of the
  inconsistency of the Greeks, who make Theseus a partaker in this history;
  and suppose him to have been acquainted with Ariadne. If we may credit
  Plutarch<a name="footnotetag225"
  href="#footnote225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>, Theseus, as soon as he was
  advanced towards manhood, went, by the advice of his mother Æthra, from
  Tr&#339;zen, in quest of his father Ægeus at Athens. This was some years
  after the Argonautic expedition; when Medea had left Jason, and put
  herself under the protection of this same Ægeus. After having been
  acknowledged by his father, Theseus went upon his expedition to Crete;
  where he is said to have first seen Ariadne, and to have carried her
  away. All this, I say, was done after Jason had married Medea, and had
  children by her; and after she had left him and was come to Athens. But
  the story of Ariadne, in the above specimen, is mentioned as a fact of
  far older date. It was prior to the arrival of Medea in Greece, and even
  to the Argonautic expedition. It is spoken of as a circumstance of the
  highest antiquity: consequently, <a name="footnotetag226"
  href="#footnote226"><sup>[226]</sup></a>Theseus could not any ways be
  concerned in it.</p>

  <p>There, is an account in Nonnus of a robe, or Pharos, which Harmonia is
  supposed to have worn when she was visited by the Goddess of beauty.
  There was delineated here, as in some above mentioned, the earth, and the
  heavens, with all the stars. The sea, too, and the rivers, were
  represented; and the whole was, at the bottom, surrounded by the
  ocean.</p>

<h2>TAR, TOR, TARIT.</h2>

  <p>I have taken notice of the fears and apprehensions, under which the
  first navigators must necessarily have been, when they traversed unknown
  seas; and were liable to be entangled among the rocks, and shelves of the
  deep: and I mentioned the expedients of which they made use to obviate
  such difficulties, and to render the coast less dangerous. They built
  upon every hill, and promontory, where they had either commerce or
  settlement, obelisks, and towers, which they consecrated to some Deity.
  These served in a twofold capacity, both as seamarks by day, and for
  beacons by night. And as people in those times made only coasting
  voyages, they continually went on shore with offerings, in order to gain
  the assistance of the God, whoever there presided; for these towers were
  temples, and oftentimes richly furnished and endowed. They were built
  sometimes on artificial mounds; but generally on natural eminences, that
  they might be seen at a great distance. They were called by the Amonians,
  who first erected them, <a name="footnotetag230"
  href="#footnote230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>Tar, and Tor; the same as the
  <span lang="he" title="TWR" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5EA;&#x5D5;&#x5E8;</bdo></span> of the Chaldees, which
  signified both a hill and tower. They were oftentimes compounded, and
  styled Tor-Is, or fire towers: on account of the light which they
  exhibited, and the fires which were preserved in them. Hence came the
  turris of the Romans; and the <span title="turis, turrhis, tursis, tursos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,
  &#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, of the Greeks. The
  latter, when the word Tor occurred in antient history, often changed it
  to <span title="tauros" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, a bull; and invented
  a number of idle stories in consequence of this change. The Ophite God
  Osiris, the same as Apollo, was by the Amonians styled Oph-El, and
  Ope-El: and there was upon the Sinus Persicus a city Opis, where his
  rites were observed. There seems likewise to have been a temple sacred to
  him, named Tor-Opel; which the Greeks rendered <span title="Tauropolos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>.

  <p>One of the principal and most antient settlements of the Amonians upon
  the ocean was at Gades; where a prince was supposed to have reigned,
  named Geryon. The harbour at Gades was a very fine one; and had several
  Tor, or Towers to direct shipping: and as it was usual to imagine the
  Deity, to whom the temple was erected, to have been the builder, this
  temple was said to have been built by Hercules. All this the Grecians
  took to themselves: they attributed the whole to the hero of Thebes: and
  as he was supposed to conquer wherever he came, they made him subdue
  Geryon; and changing the Tor, or Towers, into so many head of cattle,
  they <a name="footnotetag232"
  href="#footnote232"><sup>[232]</sup></a>describe him as leading them off
  in triumph over the Pyranees and Alpes, to Hetruria, and so on to
  Calabria. From thence, for what reason we know not, he swims them over to
  Messana in Sicily: and after some stay he swims with them through the sea
  back again, all the while holding by one of their horns. The bulls of
  Colchis, with which Jason was supposed to have engaged, were probably of
  the same nature and original. The people of this country were Amonians,
  and had once a <a name="footnotetag233"
  href="#footnote233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>mighty trade; for the security of
  which they erected at the entrance of the Phasis towers. These served
  both as light-houses, and temples; and were sacred to Adorus. They were
  on this account called Tynador, whence the Greeks formed Tyndarus,
  Tyndaris, and Tyndaridæ. They were built after some, which stood near the
  city <a name="footnotetag234"

  <p>Colchis was styled Cutaia, and had been early occupied by the sons of
  Chus. The chief city, whence the country has been in general denominated,
  was from its situation called Cal-Chus, and Col-Chus, the hill, or place
  of Chus. This by the Greeks was rendered Colchis: but as travellers are
  not uniform in expressing foreign terms, some have rendered what was
  Colchian, Chalcian, and from Colchus they have formed <span
  title="Chalkos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, brass. The Chalcian
  towers being moreover interpreted <span title="tauroi" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, bulls, a story took
  its rise about the brazen bulls of Colchis. Besides this, there was in
  these towers a constant fire kept up for the direction of ships by night:
  whence the bulls were said to breath fire.</p>

  <p>We however sometimes meet with sacred towers, which were really
  denominated Tauri from the worship of the mystic bull, the same as the
  Apis, and Mneuis of Egypt. Such was probably the temple of Minotaurus in
  Crete, where the <a name="footnotetag236"
  href="#footnote236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>Deity was represented under an
  emblematical figure; which consisted of the body of a man with the head
  of a bull. In Sicily was a promontory Taurus, mentioned by Diodorus
  Siculus; which was called also Tauromenium. He acquaints us, that Hanno
  the Carthaginian sent his Admiral with orders <span title="paraplein epi ton lophon kaloumenon Tauron" class="grk"

  Tauromenium, from the people who settled, and <a name="footnotetag237"
  href="#footnote237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>remained there: as if this were
  the only place in the world where people settled and remained. It was an
  antient compound, and no part of it of Grecian <a name="footnotetag238"
  href="#footnote238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>original. Tauromenium is the same
  as Menotaurium reversed: and the figure of the Deity was varied exactly
  in the same manner; as is apparent from the coins and engravings which
  have been found in Sicily. The Minotaur is figured as a man with the head
  of a bull; the Tauromen as a bull with the face of a <a
  name="footnotetag239" href="#footnote239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>man.</p>

  <p>Among the <a name="footnotetag240"
  href="#footnote240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>Hetrurians this term seems to
  have been taken in a more enlarged sense; and to have signified a city,
  or town fortified. When they settled in Italy, they founded many places
  of strength; and are reputed to have been the first who introduced the
  art of fortification. <a name="footnotetag241"

  Hence the word Tar, and Tur, is often found in the composition of names,
  which relate to people of this country. They worshipped the Sun, styled
  Zan, and Zeen; whose temples were called Tur-Zeen: and in consequence of
  it one of the principal names by which their country was distinguished,
  was Turzenia. The Scholiast upon Lycophron mentions it as <a

  &#x3BB;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;.</span> From Tarchon there was a city
  and district named <a name="footnotetag244"
  href="#footnote244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>Tarcunia; from whence came the
  family of the Tarquins, or Tarquinii, so well known in the history of <a
  name="footnotetag245" href="#footnote245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>Rome. The
  Amonians esteemed every emanation of light a fountain; and styled it Ain,
  and Aines: and as they built lighthouses upon every island and insular
  promontory, they were in consequence of it called Aines, Agnes, Inis,
  Inesos, Nesos, Nees: and this will be found to obtain in many different
  countries and languages. The Hetrurians occupied a large tract of
  sea-coast; on which account they worshipped Poseidon: and one of their
  principal cities was Poseidonium. They erected upon their shores towers
  and beacons for the sake of their navigation, which they called Tor-ain:
  whence they had a still farther denomination of Tur-aini, and their
  country was named Tur-ainia; the <span title="Turrhênia" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C5;&#x1FE4;&#x1FE5;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> of the
  later Greeks. All these appellations are from the same object, the
  edifices which they erected: even Hetruria seems to have been a compound
  of Ai-tur; and to have signified the land of Towers. Another name for
  buildings of this nature was Turit, or Tirit; which signified a tower or
  turret. I have often mentioned that temples have been mistaken for
  Deities, and places for persons. We have had an instance of this above;
  where Tarchon, and Tursenus are supposed to have been founders of
  colonies. Torone was a place in Macedonia; and signifies literally the
  Tower of the Sun. The Poets have formed out of it a female personage; and
  supposed her to have been the wife of <a name="footnotetag246"
  href="#footnote246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>Proteus. So Amphi-Tirit is merely
  an oracular tower. This too has by the Poets been changed to a female,
  Amphitrite; and made the wife of Neptune. The name of Triton is a
  contraction of Tirit-On; and signifies the tower of the Sun, like Torone:
  but a Deity was framed from it, who was supposed to have had the
  appearance of a man upwards, but downwards to have been like a fish. From
  this emblematical representation we may judge of the figure of the real
  Deity; and be assured that it could be no other than that of Atargatis
  and Dagon. The <a name="footnotetag247"
  href="#footnote247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>Hetrurians were thought to have
  been the inventors of trumpets: and in their towers upon the sea-coast
  there were people appointed to be continually upon the watch both by day
  and night; and to give a proper signal, if any thing happened
  extraordinary. This was done by a blast from the trumpet; and Triton was
  hence feigned to have been Neptune's trumpeter. He is accordingly
  described by Nonnus,</p>

  However in early times these brazen instruments were but little known:
  and people were obliged to make use of what was near at hand, the conchs
  of the sea, which every strand afforded. By sounding these, they gave
  signals from the top of the towers when any ship appeared: and this is
  the implement with which Triton is more commonly furnished. The antients
  divided the night into different watches; the last of which was called
  cockcrow: and in consequence of this they kept a cock in their Tirat, or
  Towers, to give notice of the dawn. Hence this bird was sacred to the
  Sun, and named Alector, <span title="Alektôr" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>: which seems to
  be a compound out of the titles of that Deity, and of the tower set apart
  for his service: for all these towers were temples. Those styled
  Tritonian were oracular; as we may infer from the application made by the
  Argonauts. What Homer attributes to Proteus, Pindar ascribes to Triton.

  Pausanias mentions a tradition of a <a name="footnotetag250"
  href="#footnote250"><sup>[250]</sup></a>Triton near Tanagra, who used to
  molest women, when they were bathing in the sea; and who was guilty of
  other acts of violence. He was at last found upon the beach overpowered
  with wine; and there slain. This Triton was properly a Tritonian, a
  priest of one of these temples: for the priests appear to have been great
  tyrants, and oftentimes very brutal. This person had used the natives
  ill; who took advantage of him, when overpowered with liquor, and put him
  to death.</p>

  <p>The term Tor, in different parts of the world, occurs sometimes a
  little varied. Whether this happened through mistake, or was introduced
  for facility of utterance, is uncertain. The temple of the Sun, Tor
  Heres, in Phenicia was rendered <span title="Triêrês" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, Trieres; the
  promontory Tor-Ope-On, in Caria, Triopon; Tor-Hamath, in Cyprus,
  Trimathus; Tor-Hanes, in India, Trinesia; Tor-Chom, or Chomus, in
  Palestine, Tricomis. In antient times the title of Anac was often
  conferred upon the Deities; and their temples were styled Tor-Anac, and
  Anac-Tor. The city Miletus was named <a name="footnotetag251"
  href="#footnote251"><sup>[251]</sup></a>Anactoria: and there was an
  Heroüm at Sparta called <span title="Anaktoron" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  Anactoron; where Castor and Pollux had particular honours, who were
  peculiarly styled Anactes. It was from Tor-Anac that Sicily was
  denominated Trinacis and Trinacia. This, in process of time, was still
  farther changed to Trinacria; which name was supposed to refer to the
  triangular form of the island. But herein was a great mistake; for, the
  more antient name was Trinacia, as is manifest from Homer:</p>

  <p>And the name, originally, did not relate to the island in general, but
  to a part only, and that a small district near Ætna. This spot had been
  occupied by the first inhabitants, the Cyclopians, Lestrygons, and
  Sicani: and it had this name from some sacred tower which they built.
  Callimachus calls it, mistakenly, Trinacria, but says that it was near
  Ætna, and a portion of the antient Sicani.</p>

  <p>I imagine that the trident of Poseidon was a mistaken implement; as it
  does not appear to have any relation to the Deity to whom it has been by
  the Poets appropriated. Both the towers on the sea-coast, and the
  beacons, which stood above them, had the name of Tor-ain. This the
  Grecians changed to Triaina, <span title="Triaina" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>, and supposed
  it to have been a three-pronged fork. The beacon, or Torain, consisted of
  an iron or brazen frame, wherein were three or four tines, which stood up
  upon a circular basis of the same metal. They were bound with a hoop; and
  had either the figures of Dolphins, or else foliage in the intervals
  between them. These filled up the vacant space between the tines, and
  made them capable of holding the combustible matter with which they were
  at night filled. This instrument was put upon a high pole, and hung
  sloping sea-ward over the battlements of the tower, or from the stern of
  a ship: with this they could maintain, either a smoke by day, or a blaze
  by night. There was a place in Argos named <a name="footnotetag258"
  href="#footnote258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>Triaina, which was supposed to
  have been so called from the trident of Neptune. It was undoubtedly a
  tower, and the true name Tor-ain; as may be shewn from the history with
  which it is attended. For it stood near a fountain, though a fountain of
  a different nature from that of which we have been speaking. The waters
  of Amumone rose here: which Amumone is a variation from Amim-On, <i>the
  waters of the Sun</i>. The stream rose close to the place, which was
  named Tor-ain, from its vicinity to the fountain.</p>

  esteemed the dog of hell. We are told by <a name="footnotetag259"
  href="#footnote259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>Eusebius, from Plutarch, that
  Cerberus was the Sun: but the term properly signified the temple, or
  place, of the Sun. The great luminary was styled by the Amonians both Or
  and Abor; that is, <i>light</i>, and <i>the parent of light:</i> and
  Cerberus is properly Kir-Abor, the place of that Deity. The same temple
  had different names, from the diversity of the God's titles who was there
  worshipped. It was called TorCaph-El; which was changed to <span
  title="trikephalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  just as Cahen-Caph-El was rendered <span title="kunokephalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>:
  and Cerberus was hence supposed to have had three heads. It was also
  styled Tor-Keren, Turris Regia; which suffered a like change with the
  word above, being expressed <span title="trikarênos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>:
  and Cahen Ades, or Cerberus, was hence supposed to have been a
  triple-headed monster. That these idle figments took their rise from
  names of places, ill expressed and misinterpreted, may be proved from
  Palæphatus. He abundantly shews that the mistake arose hence, though he
  does not point out precisely the mode of deviation. He first speaks of
  Geryon, who was supposed to have had three heads, and was thence styled

  say of Cerberus, that he was a dog with three heads: but it is plain that
  he was so called from a city named Tricaren, or Tricarenia, as well as
  Geryones</i>. Palæphatus says, very truly, that the strange notion arose
  from a place. But, to state more precisely the grounds of the mistake, we
  must observe, that from the antient Tor-Caph-El arose the blunder about
  <span title="trikephalos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>;
  as, from Tor-Keren, rendered Tricarenia, was formed the term <span
  title="trikarênos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>:
  and these personages, in consequence of it, were described with three
  heads.</p>

  <p>As I often quote from Palæphatus, it may be proper to say something
  concerning him. He wrote early: and seems to have been a serious and
  sensible person; one, who saw the absurdity of the fables, upon which the
  theology of his country was founded. In the purport of his name is
  signified an antiquarian; a person, who dealt in remote researches: and
  there is no impossibility, but that there might have casually arisen this
  correspondence between his name and writings. But, I think, it is hardly
  probable. As he wrote against the mythology of his country, I should
  imagine that <span title="Palaiphatos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Palæphatus, was an assumed name, which he took for a blind, in order to
  screen himself from persecution: for the nature of his writings made him
  liable to much ill will. One little treatise of <a name="footnotetag262"
  href="#footnote262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>Palæphatus about Orion is quoted
  verbatim by the Scholiast upon <a name="footnotetag263"
  href="#footnote263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>Homer, who speaks of it as a
  quotation from Euphorion. I should therefore think, that Euphorion was
  the name of this writer: but as there were many learned men so called, it
  may be difficult to determine which was the author of this treatise.</p>

  <p>Homer, who has constructed the noblest poem that was ever framed, from
  the strangest materials, abounds with allegory and mysterious
  description. He often introduces ideal personages, his notions of which
  he borrowed from the edifices, hills, and fountains; and from whatever
  savoured of wonder and antiquity. He seems sometimes to blend together
  two different characters of the same thing, a borrowed one, and a real;
  so as to make the true history, if there should be any truth at bottom,
  the more extraordinary and entertaining.</p>

  <p>I cannot help thinking, that Otus and Ephiâltes, those gigantic
  youths, so celebrated by the Poets, were two lofty towers. They were
  building to Alohim, called <a name="footnotetag264"
  href="#footnote264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>Aloëus; but were probably
  overthrown by an earthquake. They are spoken of by Pindar as the sons of
  Iphimedeia; and are supposed to have been slain by Apollo in the island
  Naxos.</p>

  <p>Homer includes Orion in this description, whom he mentions elsewhere;
  and seems to borrow his ideas from a similar object, some tower, or
  temple, that was sacred to him. Orion was Nimrod, the great hunter in the
  Scriptures, called by the Greeks Nebrod. He was the founder of Babel, or
  Babylon; and is represented as a gigantic personage. The author of the
  Paschal Chronicle speaks of him in this light. <a name="footnotetag267"

  <p>The Poet styles him Pelorian; which betokens something vast, and is
  applicable to any towering personage, but particularly to Orion. For the
  term Pelorus is the name by which the towers of Orion were called. Of
  these there seems to have been one in Delos; and another of more note, to
  which Homer probably alluded, in Sicily; where Orion was particularly
  reverenced. The streight of Rhegium was a dangerous pass: and this
  edifice was erected for the security of those who were obliged to go
  through it. It stood near Zancle; and was called <a name="footnotetag269"
  href="#footnote269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>Pelorus, because it was sacred to
  Alorus, the same as <a name="footnotetag270"
  href="#footnote270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>Orion. There was likewise a river
  named from him, and rendered by Lycophron <a name="footnotetag271"
  href="#footnote271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>Elorus. The tower is mentioned by
  Strabo; but more particularly by Diodorus Siculus. He informs us that,
  according to the tradition of the place, Orion there resided; and that,
  among other works, he raised this very mound and promontory, called
  Pelorus and Pelorias, together with the temple, which was situated upon
  it. <a name="footnotetag272"

  We find from hence that there was a tower of this sort, which belonged to
  Orion: and that the word Pelorion was a term borrowed from these
  edifices, and made use of metaphorically, to denote any thing stupendous
  and large. The description in Homer is of a mixed nature: wherein he
  retains the antient tradition of a gigantic person; but borrows his ideas
  from the towers sacred to him. I have taken notice before, that all
  temples of old were supposed to be oracular; and by the Amonians were
  called Pator and Patara. This temple of Orion was undoubtedly a Pator; to
  which mariners resorted to know the event of their voyage, and to make
  their offerings to the God. It was on this account styled Tor Pator;
  which being by the Greeks expressed <span title="tripatôr" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>,
  tripator, gave rise to the notion, that this earthborn giant had three
  fathers.</p>

  <p>These towers, near the sea, were made use of to form a judgment of the
  weather, and to observe the heavens: and those which belonged to cities
  were generally in the Acropolis, or higher part of the place. This, by
  the Amonians, was named Bosrah; and the citadel of Carthage, as well as
  of other cities, is known to have been so denominated. But the Greeks, by
  an unavoidable fatality, rendered it uniformly <a name="footnotetag274"

  <p>When towers were situated upon eminences fashioned very round, they
  were by the Amonians called Tith; which answers to <span lang="he"

  and <span title="titthos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, in Greek. They were
  so denominated from their resemblance to a woman's breast; and were
  particularly sacred to Orus and Osiris, the Deities of light, who by the
  Grecians were represented under the title of Apollo. Hence the summit of
  Parnassus was <a name="footnotetag278"
  href="#footnote278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>named Tithorea, from Tith-Or: and
  hard by was a city, mentioned by Pausanias, of the same name; which was
  alike sacred to Orus and Apollo. The same author takes notice of a hill,
  near Epidaurus, called <a name="footnotetag279"

  There was a summit of the like nature at Samos, which, is by Callimachus

  Tithonus, whose longevity is so much celebrated, was nothing more than
  one of these structures, a Pharos, sacred to the sun, as the name plainly
  shews. Tith-On is <span title="mastos heliou" class="grk"

  &#x1F11;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>, <i>the mount of the <a
  name="footnotetag282" href="#footnote282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>Sun</i>. As
  he supplied the place of that luminary, he is said to have been beloved
  by Aurora, and through her favour to have lived many ages. This, indeed,
  is the reverse of that which is fabled of the <a name="footnotetag283"
  href="#footnote283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>Cyclopes, whose history equally
  relates to edifices. They are said to have raised the jealousy of Apollo,
  and to have been slain by his arrows: yet it will be found at bottom of
  the same purport. The Cyclopian turrets upon the Sicilian shore fronted
  due east: and their lights must necessarily have been extinguished by the
  rays of the rising Sun. This, I imagine, is the meaning of Apollo's
  slaying the Cyclopes with his arrows. Tethys, the antient Goddess of the
  sea, was nothing else but an old tower upon a mount; of the same shape,
  and erected for the same purposes, as those above. On this account it was
  called Tith-Is, <span title="mastos puros." class="grk"

  &#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span> Thetis seems to have been a

  were not only in Greece; but in Egypt, Syria, and most parts of the
  world. They were generally formed by art; being composed of earth, raised
  very high; which was sloped gradually, and with great exactness: and the
  top of all was crowned with a fair tower. The situation of these
  buildings made them be looked upon as places of great safety: and the
  reverence in which they were held added to the security. On these
  accounts they were the repositories of much wealth and treasure: in times
  of peril they were crowded with things of value. In Assyria was a temple
  named Azara; which the Parthian plundered, and is said to have carried
  off ten thousand talents: <a name="footnotetag284"

  &#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>:
  <i>and above it two round hills like breasts, at no great distance from
  each other</i>. To such as these Solomon alludes, when he makes his
  beloved say, <a name="footnotetag287"
  href="#footnote287"><sup>[287]</sup></a><i>I am a wall, and my breasts
  like towers</i>. Though the word <span lang="he" title="CHWMH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D7;&#x5D5;&#x5DE;&#x5D4;</bdo></span>, Chumah, or Comah, be
  generally rendered a wall; yet I should think that in this place it
  signified the ground which the wall surrounded: an inclosure sacred to
  Cham, the Sun, who was particularly worshipped in such places. The
  Mizraïm called these hills Typhon, and the cities where they were
  erected, Typhonian. But as they stood within inclosures sacred to Chom,
  they were also styled Choma. This, I imagine, was the meaning of the term
  in this place, and in some others; where the text alludes to a different
  nation, and to a foreign mode of worship. In these temples the Sun was
  principally adored, and the rites of fire celebrated: and this seems to
  have been the reason why the judgment denounced against them is
  uniformly, that they shall be destroyed by fire. If we suppose Comah to
  mean a mere wall, I do not see why fire should be so particularly
  destined against a part, which is the least combustible. The Deity says,
  <a name="footnotetag288" href="#footnote288"><sup>[288]</sup></a><i>I
  will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus. <a name="footnotetag289"
  href="#footnote289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>I will send a fire on the wall of
  Gaza. <a name="footnotetag290" href="#footnote290"><sup>[290]</sup></a>I
  will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus. <a name="footnotetag291"
  href="#footnote291"><sup>[291]</sup></a>I will kindle a <a
  name="footnotetag292" href="#footnote292"><sup>[292]</sup></a>fire in the
  wall of Rabbah</i>. As the crime which brought down this curse was
  idolatry, and the term used in all these instances is Chomah; I should
  think that it related to a temple of Chom, and his high places, called by
  the Greeks <span title="lophoi mastoeideis" class="grk"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>:
  and to these the spouse of Solomon certainly alludes, when she Says,
  <span title="egô teichos, kai hoi mastoi mou hôs purgoi" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3C9; &#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;,

  &#x1F61;&#x3C2; &#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>. This
  will appear from another passage in Solomon, where he makes his beloved
  say, <a name="footnotetag293"
  href="#footnote293"><sup>[293]</sup></a><i>We have a little sister, and
  she hath no breasts. If she be a Comah, we will build upon her a palace
  of silver.</i> A palace cannot be supposed to be built upon a wall;
  though it may be inclosed with one. The place for building was a Comah,
  or eminence. It is said of Jotham, king of Judah, that <a
  name="footnotetag294" href="#footnote294"><sup>[294]</sup></a><i>on the
  wall of Ophel he built much</i>. Ophel is literally Pytho Sol, the Ophite
  Deity of Egypt and Canaan. What is here termed a wall, was a Comah, or
  high place, which had been of old erected to the sun by the Jebusites.
  This Jotham fortified, and turned it to advantage; whereas before it was
  not used, or used for a bad purpose. The ground set apart for such use
  was generally oval; and towards one extremity of the long diameter, as it
  were in the focus, were these mounds and towers erected. As they were
  generally royal edifices, and at the same time held sacred; they were
  termed Tarchon, like Tarchonium in Hetruria: which by a corruption was in
  later times rendered Trachon, <span title="Trachôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>. There were two hills
  of this denomination near Damascus; from whence undoubtedly the Regio
  Trachonitis received its name: <a name="footnotetag295"
  href="#footnote295"><sup>[295]</sup></a><span title="huperkeintai de autês (Damaskou) duo legomenoi Trachônes." class="grk"
  >&#x1F51;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;
  (&#x394;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;)
  &#x3B4;&#x3C5;&#x3BF;
  &#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;.</span> These
  were hills with towers, and must have been very fair to see to. Solomon
  takes notice of a hill of this sort upon <a name="footnotetag296"
  href="#footnote296"><sup>[296]</sup></a><i>Lebanon, looking toward
  Damascus</i>; which he speaks of as a beautiful structure. The term
  Trachon seems to have been still farther sophisticated by the Greeks, and
  expressed <span title="Drakôn" class="grk"
  >&#x394;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, Dracon: from whence
  in, great measure arose the notion of treasures being guarded by <a
  name="footnotetag297" href="#footnote297"><sup>[297]</sup></a>Dragons. We
  read of the gardens of the Hesperides being under the protection of a
  sleepless serpent: and the golden fleece at Colchis was entrusted to such
  another guardian; of which there is a fine description in Apollonius.</p>

  <p>Such are the poetical representations: but the history at bottom
  relates to sacred towers, dedicated to the symbolical worship of the

  Titanians; a people so denominated from their worship, and from the
  places where it was celebrated. They are, like Orion and the Cyclopians,
  represented as gigantic persons: and they were of the same race, the
  children of Anak. The Titanian temples were stately edifices, erected in
  Chaldea, as well as in lower Egypt, upon mounds of earth, <span

  They were by their situation strong, and probably made otherwise
  defensible.</p>

  <p>In respect to the legends about dragons, I am persuaded that the
  antients sometimes did wilfully misrepresent things, in order to increase
  the wonder. Iphicrates related, that in Mauritania there were dragons of
  such extent, that grass grew upon their backs: <a name="footnotetag303"

  What can be meant under this representation but a Dracontium, within
  whose precincts they encouraged verdure? It is said of Taxiles, a mighty
  prince in India, and a rival of Porus, that, upon the arrival of
  Alexander the Great, he shewed him every thing that was in his country
  curious, and which could win the attention of a foreigner. Among other
  things he carried him to see a <a name="footnotetag304"
  href="#footnote304"><sup>[304]</sup></a>Dragon, which was sacred to
  Dionusus; and itself esteemed a God. It was of a stupendous size, being
  in extent equal to five acres; and resided in a low deep place, walled
  round to a great height. The Indians offered sacrifices to it: and it was
  daily fed by them from their flocks and herds, which it devoured at an
  amazing rate. In short my author says, that it was treated rather as a
  tyrant, than a benevolent Deity. Two Dragons of the like nature are
  mentioned by <a name="footnotetag305"
  href="#footnote305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>Strabo; which are said to have
  resided in the mountains of Abisares, or Abiosares, in India: the one was
  eighty cubits in length, the other one hundred and forty. Similar to the
  above is the account given by Posidonius of a serpent, which he saw in
  the plains of <i>Macra</i>, a region in Syria; and which he styles <a

  about an acre in length; and of a thickness so remarkable, as that two
  persons on horseback, when they rode on the opposite sides, could not see
  one another. Each scale was as big as a, shield; and a man might ride in
  at its mouth. What can this description allude to, this <span

  ruins of an antient Ophite temple; which is represented in this
  enigmatical manner to raise admiration? The plains of Macra were not far
  from Mount Lebanon and Hermon; where the Hivites resided; and where
  serpent-worship particularly prevailed. The Indian Dragon above mentioned
  seems to have been of the same nature. It was probably a temple, and its
  environs; where a society of priests resided, who were maintained by the
  public; and who worshipped the Deity under the semblance of a serpent.
  Tityus must be ranked among the monsters of this class. He is by the
  Poets represented as a stupendous being, an earthborn giant:</p>

  <p>The same story is told of Prometheus, who is said to have been exposed
  upon Mount Caucasus, near Colchis; with this variation, that an eagle is
  placed over him, preying upon his heart. These strange histories are
  undoubtedly taken from the symbols and devices which were carved upon the
  front of the antient Amonian temples; and especially those of Egypt. The
  eagle and the vulture were the insignia of that country: whence it was
  called Ai-Gupt, and <a name="footnotetag309"
  href="#footnote309"><sup>[309]</sup></a>Aetia, from Ait and Gupt, which
  signified an eagle and vulture. Ait was properly a title of the Deity,
  and signified heat: and the heart, the centre of vital heat, was among
  the Egyptians styled <a name="footnotetag310"

  Apollo, that a heart over burning coals was an emblem of Egypt. The
  Amonians dealt much in hieroglyphical representations. Nonnus mentions
  one of this sort, which seems to have been a curious emblem of the Sun.
  It was engraved upon a jasper, and worn for a bracelet. Two serpents
  entwined together, with their heads different ways, were depicted in a
  semicircular manner round the extreme part of the gem. At the top between
  their heads was an eagle; and beneath a sacred carriage, called
  Cemus.</p>

  <p>The history of Tityus, Prometheus, and many other poetical personages,
  was certainly taken from hieroglyphics misunderstood, and badly
  explained. Prometheus was worshipped by the Colchians as a Deity; and had
  a temple and high place, called <a name="footnotetag313"
  href="#footnote313"><sup>[313]</sup></a><span title="Petra Tuphaonia" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;
  &#x3A4;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, upon
  Mount Caucasus: and the device upon the portal was Egyptian, an eagle
  over a heart. The magnitude of these personages was taken from the extent
  of the temple inclosures. The words, per tota novem cui jugera corpus
  Porrigitur, relate to a garden of so many acres. There were many such
  inclosures, as I have before taken notice: some of them were beautifully
  planted, and ornamented with pavilions and fountains, and called
  Paradisi. One of this sort stood in Syria upon the river <a
  name="footnotetag314" href="#footnote314"><sup>[314]</sup></a>Typhon,
  called afterwards Orontes. Places of this nature are alluded to under the
  description of the gardens of the Hesperides, and Alcinous; and the
  gardens of Adonis. Such were those at Phaneas in Palestine; and those
  beautiful gardens of Daphne upon the Orontes above mentioned; and in the
  shady parts of Mount Libanus. Those of Daphne are described by Strabo,
  who mentions, <a name="footnotetag315"

  <i>There was a fine wide extended grove, which sheltered the whole place;
  and which was watered with numberless fountains. In the centre of the

  Groves of Daphne upon the mountains Heræi in Sicily, and the garden and
  temple at bottom were very noble; and are finely described by <a
  name="footnotetag316"
  href="#footnote316"><sup>[316]</sup></a>Diodorus.</p>

  <p>I have taken notice that the word <span title="drakôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, draco, was a mistake
  for Tarchon, <span title="Tarchôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>: which was sometimes
  expressed <span title="Trachôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>; as is observable in
  the Trachones at Damascus. When the Greeks understood that in these
  temples people <ins class="correction" title="'woshipped' in original"
  >worshipped</ins> a <ins class="correction" title="'sepent' in original"
  >serpent</ins> Deity, they concluded that Trachon was a serpent: and
  hence came the name of Draco to be appropriated to such an animal. For
  the Draco was an imaginary being, however afterwards accepted and
  understood. This is manifest from Servius, who distributes the serpentine
  species into three tribes; and confines the Draco solely to temples: <a
  name="footnotetag317" href="#footnote317"><sup>[317]</sup></a>Angues
  aquarum sunt, serpentes terrarum, Dracones templorum. That the notion of
  such animals took its rise from the temples of the Syrians and Egyptians,
  and especially from the Trachones, <span title="Trachônes" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, at
  Damascus, seems highly probable from the accounts above: and it may be
  rendered still more apparent from Damasenus, a supposed hero, who took
  his name from the city Damasene, or Damascus. He is represented as an
  earthborn giant, who encountered two dragons: <a name="footnotetag318"

  &#x39F;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, <i>a serpent in extent of fifty
  acres</i>: which certainly, as I have before insinuated, must have a
  reference to the grove and garden, wherein such Ophite temple stood at
  Damascus. For the general measurement of all these wonderful beings by <a
  name="footnotetag319" href="#footnote319"><sup>[319]</sup></a>jugera or
  acres proves that such an estimate could not relate to any thing of solid
  contents; but to an inclosure of that superficies. Of the same nature as
  these was the gigantic personage, supposed, to have been seen at Gades by
  Cleon Magnesius. He made, it seems, no doubt of Tityus and other such
  monsters having existed. For being at Gades, he was ordered to go upon a
  certain expedition by Hercules: and upon his return to the island, he saw
  upon the shore a huge sea-man, who had been thunderstruck, and lay
  extended upon the ground: <a name="footnotetag320"

  are said to have been killed by lightning. Orpheus too, who by some is

  <p>All these histories relate to sacred inclosures; and to the worship of
  the serpent, and rites of fire, which were practised within them. Such an
  inclosure was by the Greeks styled <a name="footnotetag322"

  were no longer taken in their original sense; but supposed uniformly to
  have been places of sepulture. This has turned many temples into tombs:
  and the Deities, to whom they were sacred, have been represented as there
  buried. There was an Orphic Dracontium at Lesbos; where a serpent was
  supposed to have been going to devour the remains of Orpheus: and this
  temple being of old styled Petra, it was fabled of the serpent, that he
  was turned into stone.</p>

  <p>All the poetical accounts of heroes engaging with dragons have arisen
  from a misconception about these towers and temples; which those persons
  either founded, or else took in war. Or, if they were Deities of whom the
  story is told, these buildings were erected to their honour. But the
  Greeks made no distinction. They were fond of heroism; and interpreted
  every antient history according to their own prejudices: and in the most
  simple narrative could find out a martial achievement. No colony could
  settle any where, and build an Ophite temple, but there was supposed to
  have been a contention between a hero and a dragon. Cadmus, as I have
  shewn, was described in conflict with such an one near Thebes, whose
  teeth he sowed in the earth:</p>

  <p>We often read of virgins, who were exposed to dragons and
  sea-monsters; and of dragons which laid waste whole provinces, till they
  were at length, by some person of prowess, encountered and slain. These
  histories relate to women, who were immured in towers by the sea-side;
  and to banditti, who got possession of these places, whence they infested
  the adjacent country. The <a name="footnotetag333"

  supposes, that Andromeda, whom the poets describe as chained to a rock,
  and exposed to a sea-monster, was in reality confined in a temple of
  Neptune, a Petra of another sort. These dragons are represented as
  sleepless; because, in such places there were commonly lamps burning, and
  a watch maintained. In those more particularly set apart for religious
  service there was a fire, which never went out.</p>

  <p>What the Poet styles the eyes of the Dragon, were undoubtedly windows
  in the upper part of the building, through which the fire appeared.
  Plutarch takes notice, that in the temple of Amon there was a <a

  continually burning. The like was observable in other temples of the <a

  Pausanias mentions the lamp of Minerva <a name="footnotetag337"

  went out: the same custom was kept up in most of the <a

  The Chaldeans and Persians had sacred hearths; on which they preserved a
  <a name="footnotetag339"
  href="#footnote339"><sup>[339]</sup></a>perpetual fire. In the temple of
  <a name="footnotetag340" href="#footnote340"><sup>[340]</sup></a>Apollo
  Carneus at Cyrene, the fire upon the altar was never suffered to be
  extinguished. A like account is given by Said Ebn Batrick of the sacred
  fire, which was preserved in the great temple at <a name="footnotetag341"
  href="#footnote341"><sup>[341]</sup></a>Aderbain in Armenia. The Nubian
  Geographer mentions a nation in India, called <a name="footnotetag342"
  href="#footnote342"><sup>[342]</sup></a>Caimachitæ, who had large
  Puratheia, and maintained a perpetual fire. According to the Levitical
  law, a constant fire was to be kept up upon the altar of God. <a

  <p>From what has preceded, we may perceive, that many personages have
  been formed out of places. And I cannot help suspecting much more of
  antient history, than I dare venture to acknowledge. Of the mythic age I
  suppose almost every circumstance to have been imported, and adopted; or
  else to be a fable. I imagine, that Chiron, so celebrated for his
  knowledge, was a mere personage formed from a tower, or temple, of that
  name. It stood in Thessaly; and was inhabited by a set of priests, called
  Centauri. They were so denominated from the Deity they worshipped, who
  was represented under a particular form. They styled him Cahen-Taur: and
  he was the same as the Minotaur of Crete, and the Tauromen of Sicilia;
  consequently of an emblematical and mixed figure. The people, by whom
  this worship was introduced, were many of them Anakim; and are
  accordingly represented as of great strength and stature. Such persons
  among the people of the east were styled <a name="footnotetag344"
  href="#footnote344"><sup>[344]</sup></a>Nephelim: which the Greeks in
  after times supposed to relate to <span title="nephelê" class="grk"
  >&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>, a cloud. In
  consequence of this, they described the Centaurs as born of a cloud: and
  not only the Centaurs, but Ixion, and others, were reputed of the same
  original. The chief city of the Nephelim stood in Thessaly, and is
  mentioned by <a name="footnotetag345"
  href="#footnote345"><sup>[345]</sup></a>Palæphatus: but through the
  misconception of his countrymen it was expressed <span title="Nephelê" class="grk"
  >&#x39D;&#x3B5;&#x3C6;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span>, Nephele, a cloud. The
  Grecians in general were of this race; as will be abundantly shewn. The
  Scholiast upon Lycophron mentions, that the descendants of Hellen were by
  a woman named Nephele, whom Athamas was supposed to have married. <a

  distinction between Helle, and Hellen; the former of which he describes
  in the feminine. By Phrixus is meant <span title="Phrux" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BE;</span>, Phryx, who passed the Hellespont,
  and settled in Asia minor. However obscured the history may be, I think
  the purport of it is plainly this, that the Hellenes, and Phrygians were
  of the Nephelim or Anakim race. Chiron was a temple, probably at Nephele
  in Thessalia, the most antient seat of the Nephelim. His name is a
  compound of Chir-On, in purport the same as Kir-On, the tower and temple
  of the Sun. In places of this sort people used to study the heavenly
  motions: and they were made use of for seminaries, where young people
  were instructed; on which account they were styled <span

  could not be true of Chiron as a person: for, unless we suppose him to
  have been, as the Poets would persuade us, of a different species from
  the rest of mankind, it will be found impossible for him to have had
  pupils in such different ages. For not only Æsculapius, mentioned in this

  Xenophon indeed, who was aware of this objection, says, that the term of
  Chiron's life was sufficient for the performance of all that was
  attributed to him: <a name="footnotetag352"

  nothing in proof of what he alleges. It is moreover incredible, were we
  to suppose such a being as Chiron, that he should have had pupils from so
  many different <a name="footnotetag353"
  href="#footnote353"><sup>[353]</sup></a>countries. Besides many of them,
  who are mentioned, were manifestly ideal personages. For not to speak of
  Cephalus and Castor, Apollo was a Deity; and Æsculapius was the <a
  name="footnotetag354" href="#footnote354"><sup>[354]</sup></a>like: by
  some indeed esteemed the son of the former; by others introduced rather
  as a title, and annexed to the names of different Gods. Aristides uses it
  as such in his invocation of <a name="footnotetag355"
  href="#footnote355"><sup>[355]</sup></a>Hercules: <span title="Iô, Paian, Hêrakles, Asklêpie" class="grk"

  to suppose that these personages could have been pupils to Chiron. Those
  that were instructed, whoever they may have been, partook only of
  Chironian education; and were taught in the same kind of academy: but not
  by one person, nor probably in the same place. For there were many of
  these towers, where they taught astronomy, music, and other sciences.
  These places were likewise courts of judicature, where justice was

  <p>Right was probably more fairly determined in the Chironian temples,
  than in others. Yet the whole was certainly attended with some instances
  of cruelty: for human sacrifices are mentioned as once common, especially
  at Pella in Thessaly; where, if they could get a person, who was an
  Achean by birth, they used to offer him at the altars of Peleus and <a
  name="footnotetag358" href="#footnote358"><sup>[358]</sup></a>Chiron.</p>

  <p>There were many edifices denominated Chironian, and sacred to the Sun.
  Charon was of the same purport, and etymology; and was sacred to the same
  Deity. One temple of this name, and the most remarkable of any, stood
  opposite to Memphis on the western side of the Nile. It was near the spot
  where most people of consequence were buried. There is a tower in this
  province, but at some distance from the place here spoken of, called <a
  name="footnotetag359" href="#footnote359"><sup>[359]</sup></a>Kiroon at
  this day. As Charon was a temple near the catacombs, or place of burial;
  all the persons who were brought to be there deposited, had an offering
  made on their account, upon being landed on this shore. Hence arose the
  notion of the fee of Charon, and of the ferryman of that name. This
  building stood upon the banks of a canal, which communicated with the
  Nile: but that which is now called Kiroon, stands at some distance to the
  west, upon the lake <a name="footnotetag360"
  href="#footnote360"><sup>[360]</sup></a>M&#339;ris; where only the kings
  of Egypt had a right of sepulture. The region of the catacombs was called
  the Acheronian and <a name="footnotetag361"
  href="#footnote361"><sup>[361]</sup></a>Acherusian plain, and likewise
  the Elysian: and the stream, which ran by it, had the name of Acheron.
  They are often alluded to by Homer, and other Poets, when they treat of
  the region of departed souls. The Amonians conferred these names upon
  other places, where they settled, in different parts of the world. They
  are therefore to be met with in <a name="footnotetag362"
  href="#footnote362"><sup>[362]</sup></a>Phrygia, <a name="footnotetag363"
  href="#footnote363"><sup>[363]</sup></a>Epirus, <a name="footnotetag364"

  href="#footnote365"><sup>[365]</sup></a>Apulia, <a name="footnotetag366"
  href="#footnote366"><sup>[366]</sup></a>Campania, and other countries.
  The libri <a name="footnotetag367"
  href="#footnote367"><sup>[367]</sup></a>Acherontii in Italy, mentioned by
  Arnobius, were probably transcripts from some hieroglyphical writings,
  which had been preserved in the Acherontian towers of the Nile. These
  were carried by Tages to Hetruria; where they were held in great
  veneration.</p>

  <p>As towers of this sort were seminaries of learning, Homer from one of
  them has formed the character of sage Mentor; under whose resemblance the
  Goddess of wisdom was supposed to be concealed. By Mentor, I imagine,
  that the Poet covertly alludes to a temple of Menes. It is said, that
  Homer in an illness was cured by one <a name="footnotetag368"
  href="#footnote368"><sup>[368]</sup></a>Mentor, the son of <span
  title="Alkimos" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Alcimus. The
  person probably was a Mentorian priest, who did him this kind office, if
  there be any truth in the story. It was from an oracular temple styled
  Mentor; and Man-Tor, that the sacred cakes had the name of Amphimantora.

  <p>Castor, the supposed disciple of Chiron, was in reality the same as
  Chiron; being a sacred tower, a Chironian edifice, which served both for
  a temple and Pharos. As these buildings for the most part stood on
  strands of the sea, and promontories; Castor was esteemed in consequence
  of it a tutelary Deity of that element. The name seems to be a compound
  of Ca-Astor, the temple or place of Astor; who was rendered at different
  times Asterius, Asterion, and Astarte. Ca-Astor was by the Greeks
  abbreviated to Castor; which in its original sense I should imagine
  betokened a fire-tower: but the Greeks in this instance, as well as in
  innumerable others, have mistaken the place and temple for the Deity, to
  whom it was consecrated. The whole history of Castor and Pollux, the two
  Dioscuri, is very strange and inconsistent. Sometimes they are described
  as two mortals of Lacedæmon, who were guilty of violence and rapine, and
  were slain for their wickedness. At other times they are represented as
  the two principal Deities; and styled Dii Magni, Dii Maximi, Dii
  Potentes, Cabeiri. Mention is made by Pausanias of the great regard paid
  to them, and particularly by the Cephalenses. <a name="footnotetag370"

  though Castor was enshrined, as a God, he was properly a Tarchon, such as
  I have before described; and had all the requisites which are to be found
  in such buildings. They were the great repositories of treasure; which
  people there entrusted, as to places of great security. The temple of
  Castor vas particularly famous on this account, as we may learn from
  Juvenal:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>The Deity, who was alluded to under the name of Castor, was the Sun:
  and he had several temples of that denomination in Laconia, and other
  parts of Greece. His rites were first introduced by people from Egypt and
  Canaan. This we may infer, among other circumstances, from the title of
  Anac being so particularly conferred on him and his brother Pollux:
  whence their temple was styled <span title="Anakeion" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> in
  Laconia; and their festival at Athens <span title="anakeia" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, anakeia. For
  Anac was a Canaanitish term of honour; which the Greeks changed to <span
  title="anax" class="grk">&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;</span> and <a
  name="footnotetag374" href="#footnote374"><sup>[374]</sup></a><span
  title="anaktes" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>. I have before
  mentioned, that in these places were preserved the Archives of the cities
  and provinces in which they stood: and they were often made use of for
  courts of judicature, called <span title="prutaneia" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>,
  and prætoria; whither the antient people of the place resorted, to
  determine about right and wrong. Hence it is that Castor and Pollux, two
  names of the same personage, were supposed to preside over judicial
  affairs. This department does but ill agree with the general and absurd
  character, under which they are represented: for what has horsemanship
  and boxing to do with law and equity? But these were mistaken attributes,
  which arose from a misapplication of history. Within the precincts of
  their temples was a parade for boxing and wrestling; and often an
  Hippodromus. Hence arose these attributes, by which the Poets celebrated
  these personages:</p>

  <p>On this account the same province of supreme judge was conferred on
  his substitute Castor, in conjunction with his brother Pollux: and they
  were accordingly looked upon as the conservators of the rights of
  mankind. Cicero makes a noble appeal to them in his seventh oration
  against Verres; and enlarges upon the great department, of which they
  were presumed to be possessed: at the same time mentioning the treasures,
  which were deposited in their temples. <a name="footnotetag377"
  href="#footnote377"><sup>[377]</sup></a>Vos omnium rerum forensium,
  consiliorum maximorum, legum, judiciorumque arbitri, et testes,
  celeberrimo in loco PRÆTORII locati, Castor et Pollux; quorum ex templo

  victûs, legum, morum, mansuetudinis, humanitatis exempla hominibus et

  at the close joined with Ceres, and Libera; and spoken of as the
  civilizers of the world: but their peculiar province was law and
  judicature.</p>

  <p>Many instances to the same purpose might be produced; some few of
  which I will lay before the reader. Trophonius, like Chiron and Castor,
  was a sacred tower; being compounded of Tor-Oph-On, Solis Pythonis
  turris, rendered Trophon, and Trophonius. It was an oracular temple,
  situated near a vast cavern: and the responses were given by dreams.
  Tiresias, that antient prophet, was an edifice of the same nature: and
  the name is a compound of Tor-Ees, and Tor-Asis; from whence the Greeks
  formed the word Tiresias. He is generally esteemed a diviner, or
  soothsayer, to whom people applied for advice: but it was to the temple
  that they applied, and to the Deity, who was there supposed to reside. He
  was, moreover, said to have lived nine ages: till he was at last taken by
  the Epigoni, when he died. The truth is, there was a tower of this name
  at Thebes, built by the Amonians, and sacred to the God Orus. It stood
  nine ages, and was then demolished. It was afterwards repaired, and made
  use of for a place of augury: and its situation was close to the temple
  of Amon. <a name="footnotetag378"

  Tiresias, according to Apollodorus, was the son of Eueres, <a
  name="footnotetag379" href="#footnote379"><sup>[379]</sup></a><span
  title="Euêrês" class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3C5;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, or, according to the
  true Dorian pronunciation, Euares, the same as the Egyptian Uc Arez, the
  Sun. He is by Hyginus styled <a name="footnotetag380"
  href="#footnote380"><sup>[380]</sup></a>Eurimi filius; and in another
  place Eurii filius, Pastor. Eurius, Eurimus, Euarez, are all names of the
  Sun, or places sacred to him; but changed to terms of relation by not
  being understood. Tiresias is additionally styled Pastor; because all the
  Amonian Deities, as well as their princes, were called Shepherds: and
  those, who came originally from Chaldea, were styled the children of Ur,
  or Urius.</p>

  <p>By the same analogy we may trace the true history of Terambus, the
  Deity of Egypt, who was called the Shepherd Terambus. The name is a
  compound of Tor-Ambus, or Tor-Ambi, the oracular tower of Ham. He is said
  to have been the son of Eusires, <a name="footnotetag381"
  href="#footnote381"><sup>[381]</sup></a><span title="Euseirou tou Poseidônos" class="grk"

  and to have come over, and settled in Thessaly, near mount Othrys.
  According to Antonius Liberalis, he was very rich in flocks, and a great
  musician, and particularly expert in all pastoral measure. To him they
  attributed the invention of the pipe. The meaning of the history is, I
  think, too plain, after what has preceded, to need a comment. It is
  fabled of him, that he was at last turned into a bird called Cerambis, or
  Cerambix. Terambus and Cerambis are both antient terms of the same
  purport: the one properly expressed is Tor-Ambi; the other Cer-Ambi, the
  oracular temple of the Sun.</p>

  <p>I have taken notice that towers of this sort were the repositories of
  much treasure; and they were often consecrated to the Ophite Deity,
  called Opis and Oupis. It is the same which Callimachus addresses by the
  title of <a name="footnotetag382"
  href="#footnote382"><sup>[382]</sup></a><span title="Oupi, Anass' euôpi" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;, &#x391;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C3;'
  &#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;</span>: and of whom Cicero speaks,
  and styles Upis; <a name="footnotetag383"
  href="#footnote383"><sup>[383]</sup></a>quam Græci Upim paterno nomine
  appellant. The temple was hence called Kir-Upis; which the Grecians
  abridged to <span title="Grupes" class="grk"
  >&#x393;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>: and finding many of
  the Amonian temples in the north, with the device of a winged serpent
  upon the frontal, they gave this name to the hieroglyphic. Hence, I
  imagine, arose the notion of <span title="Grupes" class="grk"
  >&#x393;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, or Gryphons; which,
  like the dragons abovementioned, were supposed to be guardians of
  treasure, and to never sleep. The real conservators of the wealth were
  the priests. They kept up a perpetual fire, and an unextinguished light
  in the night. From Kir Upis, the place of his residence, a priest was
  named Grupis; and from Kir-Uph-On, Gryphon. The Poets have represented
  the Grupes as animals of the serpentine kind; and supposed them to have
  been found in countries of the Arimaspians, Alazonians, Hyperboreans, and
  other the most northern regions, which the Amonians possessed. In some of
  the temples women officiated, who were denominated from the Deity they
  served. The Scholiast upon Callimachus calls the chief of them Upis; and
  styles her, and her associates, <span title="Koras" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> <a name="footnotetag384"

  Hyperborean young women. The Hyperboreans, Alazonians, Arimaspians, were
  Scythic nations of the same family. All the stories about Prometheus,
  Chimæra, Medusa, Pegasus, Hydra, as well as of the Grupes, or Gryphons,
  arose, in great measure, from the sacred devices upon the entablatures of
  temples.</p>

<h2>TAPH, TUPH, TAPHOS.</h2>

  <p>There was another name current among the Amonians, by which they
  called their <span title="lophoi" class="grk"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, or high places. This was
  Taph; which at times was rendered Tuph, Toph, and Taphos. Lower Egypt
  being a flat, and annually overflowed, the natives were forced to raise
  the soil, on which they built their principal edifices, in order to
  secure them from the inundation: and many of their sacred towers were
  erected upon conical mounds of earth. But there were often hills of the
  same form constructed for religious purposes, upon which there was no
  building. These were very common in Egypt. Hence we read of Taphanis, or
  Taph-Hanes, Taph-Osiris, Taph-Osiris parva, and contra Taphias, in
  Antoninus; all of this country. In other parts were Taphiousa, Tape,
  Taphura, Tapori, Taphus, Taphosus, Taphitis. All these names relate to
  high altars, upon which they used oftentimes to offer human sacrifices.
  Typhon was one of these; being a compound of Tuph-On, which signifies the
  hill or altar of the Sun. Tophet, where the Israelites made their
  children pass through fire to <a name="footnotetag385"
  href="#footnote385"><sup>[385]</sup></a>Moloch, was a mount of this form.
  And there seem to have been more than one of this denomination; as we
  learn from the prophet Jeremiah, <a name="footnotetag386"
  href="#footnote386"><sup>[386]</sup></a><i>They have built the high
  places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn
  their sons and their daughters in the fire.</i> And in another place:
  <i>They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with
  fire for burnt-offerings unto Baal.</i> These cruel operations were
  generally performed upon mounts of this sort; which, from their conical
  figure, were named Tuph and Tupha. It seems to have been a term current
  in many countries. The high Persian <a name="footnotetag387"
  href="#footnote387"><sup>[387]</sup></a>bonnet had the same name from its
  shape: and Bede mentions a particular kind of standard in his time; which
  was made of plumes in a globular shape, and called in like manner, <a
  name="footnotetag388" href="#footnote388"><sup>[388]</sup></a>Tupha,
  vexilli genus, ex consertis plumarum globis. There was probably a
  tradition, that the calf, worshipped by the Israelites in the wilderness
  near Horeb, was raised upon a sacred mound, like those described above:
  for Philo Judæus says, that it was exhibited after the model of an
  Egyptian Tuphos: <a name="footnotetag389"
  href="#footnote389"><sup>[389]</sup></a><span title="Aiguptiakou mimêma Tuphou" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3B3;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;
  &#x3A4;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>. This I do not take to have
  been a Grecian word; but the name of a sacred orbicular mount, analogous
  to the Touphas of Persis.</p>

  <p>The Amonians, when they settled in Greece, raised many of these Tupha,
  or Tapha, in different parts. These, beside their original name, were
  still farther denominated from some title of the Deity, to whose honour
  they were erected. But as it was usual, in antient times, to bury persons
  of distinction under heaps of earth formed in this fashion; these Tapha
  came to signify tombs: and almost all the sacred mounds, raised for
  religious purposes, were looked upon as monuments of deceased heroes.
  Hence <a name="footnotetag390"
  href="#footnote390"><sup>[390]</sup></a>Taph-Osiris was rendered <span
  title="taphos" class="grk">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or
  the burying place of the God Osiris: and as there were many such places
  in Egypt and Arabia, sacred to Osiris and Dionusus; they were all by the
  Greeks esteemed places of sepulture. Through this mistake many different
  nations had the honour attributed to them of these Deities being interred
  in their country. The tumulus of the Latines was mistaken in the same
  manner. It was originally a sacred hillock; and was often raised before
  temples, as an altar; such as I have before described. It is represented
  in this light by Virgil:</p>

  <p>In process of time the word tumulus was in great measure looked upon
  as a tomb; and tumulo signified to bury. The Greeks speak of numberless
  sepulchral monuments, which they have thus misinterpreted. They pretended
  to shew the tomb of <a name="footnotetag392"

  <p>I make no doubt, but that there was some high place in Crete, which
  the later Greeks, and especially those who were not of the country,
  mistook for a tomb. But it certainly must have been otherwise esteemed by
  those who raised it: for it is not credible, however blind idolatry may
  have been, that people should enshrine persons as immortal, where they
  had the plainest evidences of their mortality. An inscription <i>Viro
  Immortali</i> was in a style of flattery too refined for the simplicity
  of those ages. If divine honours were conferred, they were the effects of
  time, and paid at some distance; not upon the spot, at the vestibule of
  the charnel-house. Besides, it is evident, that most of the deified
  personages never existed: but were mere titles of the Deity, the Sun; as
  has been, in great measure, proved by Macrobius. Nor was there ever any
  thing of such detriment to antient history, as the supposing that the
  Gods of the Gentile world had been natives of the countries, where they
  were worshipped. They have by these means been admitted into the annals
  of times: and it has been the chief study of the learned to register the
  legendary stories concerning them; to conciliate absurdities, and to
  arrange the whole in a chronological series. A fruitless labour, and
  inexplicable: for there are in all these fables such inconsistences, and
  contradictions, as no art, nor industry, can remedy. Hence, all who have
  expended their learning to this purpose, are in opposition to one
  another, and often at variance with themselves. Some of them by these
  means have rendered their works, which might have been of infinite use to
  the world, little better than the reveries of Monsieur Voltaire. The
  greatest part of the Grecian theology arose from misconceptions and
  blunders: and the stories concerning their Gods and Heroes were founded
  on terms misinterpreted and abused. Thus from the word <span
  title="taphos" class="grk">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  taphos, which they adopted in a limited sense, they formed a notion of
  their gods having been buried in every place, where there was a tumulus
  to their honour. This misled bishop Cumberland, Usher, Pearson, Petavius,
  Scaliger, with numberless other learned men; and among the foremost the
  great Newton. This extraordinary genius has greatly impaired the
  excellent system, upon which he proceeded, by admitting these fancied
  beings into chronology. We are so imbued in our childhood with notions of
  Mars, Hercules, and the rest of the celestial outlaws, that we scarce
  ever can lay them aside. We absolutely argue upon Pagan principles: and
  though we cannot believe the fables, which have been transmitted to us;
  yet we forget ourselves continually; and make inferences from them, as if
  they were real. In short, till we recollect ourselves, we are
  semi-pagans. It gives one pain to see men of learning, and principle,
  debating which was the Jupiter who lay with Semele; and whether it was
  the same that outwitted Amphitryon. This is not, says a critic, the
  Hermes, who cut off Argus's head; but one of later date, who turned
  Battus into a stone. I fancy, says another, that this was done, when Iö
  was turned into a cow. It is said of Jupiter, that he made the night, in
  which he enjoyed Alcmena, as long as <a name="footnotetag394"
  href="#footnote394"><sup>[394]</sup></a>three; or, as some say, as long
  as nine. The Abbe <a name="footnotetag395"
  href="#footnote395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>Banier with some phlegm excepts
  to this coalition of nights; and is unwilling to allow it. But he is
  afterwards more complying; and seems to give it his sanction, with this
  proviso, that chronological verity be not thereby impeached. <i>I am of
  opinion</i>, says he, <i>that there was no foundation for the fable of
  Jupiter's having made the night, on which he lay with Alcmena, longer
  than others: at least this event put nothing in nature out of order;
  since the day, which followed, was proportionably shorter, as Plautus <a

  <p>Were it not invidious, I could subjoin names to every article, which I

  <p>It may be said, that I run counter to the opinions of all antiquity:
  that all the fathers who treated of this subject, and many other learned
  men, supposed the Gods of the heathen to have been deified mortals, who
  were worshipped in the countries, where they died. It was the opinion of
  Clemens, Eusebius, Cyril, Tertullian, Athenagoras, Epiphanius,
  Lactantius, Arnobius, Julius Firmicus, and many others. What is more to
  the purpose, it was the opinion of the heathen themselves; the very
  people, by whom these gods were honoured: yet still it is a mistake. In
  respect to the fathers, the whole of their argument turns upon this
  point, the concessions of the Gentiles. The more early writers of the
  church were not making a strict chronological inquiry: but were labouring
  to convert the heathen. They therefore argue with them upon their own
  principles; and confute them from their own testimony. The Romans had
  their Dii Immortales; the Greeks their <span title="Theoi Athanatoi" class="grk"
  >&#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;
  &#x391;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>: yet
  acknowledged that they had been men; that they died, and were buried.
  Cicero owns; <a name="footnotetag397"
  href="#footnote397"><sup>[397]</sup></a>ab Euhemero et mortes, et
  sepulturæ demonstrantur deorum. It matters not whether the notion were
  true; the fathers very fairly make use of it. They avail themselves of
  these concessions; and prove from them the absurdity of the Gentile
  worship, and the inconsistency of their opinions. Even Maximus Tyrius,
  the Platonic, could not but smile, at being shewn in the same place the
  temple, and tomb of the deity<a name="footnotetag398"
  href="#footnote398"><sup>[398]</sup></a>; <span title="hieron Theou, kai taphon Theou" class="grk"

  &#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>. These supposed places of sepulture
  were so numerous, that Clemens Alexandrinus tells us, they were not to be
  counted. <a name="footnotetag399"

  <span title="Taphoi" class="grk"

  conical mounds of earth; on which in the first ages offerings were made
  by fire. Hence <span title="tuphô" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3C9;</span>, tupho, signified to make a smoke,
  such as arose from incense upon these Tupha, or eminences. Besides, if
  these were deified men, who were buried under these hills; how can we
  explain the difficulty of the same person being buried in different
  places, and at different times? To this it is answered, that it was
  another Bacchus, and another Jupiter. Yet this still adds to the
  difficulty: for it is hard to conceive, that whoever in any country had
  the name of Jupiter, should be made a God. Add to this, that Homer and
  Hesiod, and the authors of the Orphic poetry, knew of no such duplicates.
  There is no hint of this sort among the antient writers of their nation.
  It was a refinement in after ages; introduced to obviate the
  difficulties, which arose from the absurdities in the pagan system.
  Arnobius justly ridicules the idle expedients, made use of to render a
  base theology plausible. Gods, of the same name and character, were
  multiplied to make their fables consistent; that there might be always
  one ready at hand upon any chronological emergency. Hence no difficulty
  could arise about a Deity, but there might be one produced, adapted to
  all climes, and to every age. <a name="footnotetag400"
  href="#footnote400"><sup>[400]</sup></a>Aiunt Theologi vestri, et
  vetustatis absconditæ conditores, tres in rerum naturâ Joves
  esse&mdash;quinque Soles, et Mercurios quinque. Aiunt iidem Theologi
  quatuor esse Vulcanos, et tres Dianas; Æsculapios totidem, et Dionysos
  quinque; ter binos Hercules, et quatuor Veneres; tria genera Castorum,
  totidemque Musarum. But Arnobius is too modest. Other writers insist upon
  a greater variety. In respect to Jupiters, Varro according to Tertullian
  makes them in number three hundred. <a name="footnotetag401"
  href="#footnote401"><sup>[401]</sup></a>Varro trecentos Joves, sive
  Jupiteres, dicendum, &mdash;&mdash; introducit. The same writer mentions
  forty heroes of the name of Hercules; all which variety arose from the
  causes above assigned: and the like multiplicity may be found both of
  kings and heroes; of kings, who did not reign; of heroes, who never
  existed. The same may be observed in the accounts transmitted of their
  most early prophets, and poets: scarce any of them stand single: there
  are duplicates of every denomination. On this account it is highly
  requisite for those, who suppose these personages to have been men, and
  make inferences from the circumstances of their history, to declare
  explicitly which they mean; and to give good reasons for their
  determination. It is said of Jupiter, that he was the son of Saturn; and
  that he carried away Europa, before the arrival of Cadmus. He had
  afterwards an amour with Semele, the supposed daughter of Cadmus: and
  they mention his having a like intimacy with Alcmena an age or two later.
  After this he got acquainted with Leda, the wife of Tyndarus: and he had
  children at the siege of Troy. If we may believe the poets, and all our
  intelligence comes originally from the poets, Jupiter was personally
  interested in that war. But this interval contains little less than two
  hundred years. These therefore could not be the actions of one man: on
  which account I want to know, why Sir Isaac Newton <a
  name="footnotetag402" href="#footnote402"><sup>[402]</sup></a>in his
  chronological interpretations chooses to be determined by the story of
  Jupiter and Europa, rather than by that of Jupiter and Leda. The learned
  <a name="footnotetag403" href="#footnote403"><sup>[403]</sup></a>Pezron
  has pitched upon a Jupiter above one thousand years earlier, who was in
  like manner the son of Saturn. But Saturn, according to some of the best
  mythologists, was but four generations inclusive before the æra of Troy.
  Latinus, the son of Faunus, was alive some years after that city had been
  taken; when Æneas was supposed to have arrived in Italy. The poet tells
  us, <a name="footnotetag404"
  href="#footnote404"><sup>[404]</sup></a>Fauno Picus pater: isque parentem
  Te, Saturne, refert; Tu sanguinis ultimus auctor. The series amounts only
  to four, Latinus, Faunus, Picus, Saturn. What authority has Pezron for
  the anticipation of which he is guilty in determining the reign of
  Jupiter? and how can he reconcile these contradictory histories? He ought
  to have given some good reason for setting aside the more common and
  accepted accounts; and placing these events so <a name="footnotetag405"
  href="#footnote405"><sup>[405]</sup></a>early. Shall we suppose with the
  critics and commentators that this was a prior Jupiter? If it were a
  different person, the circumstances of his life should be different: but
  the person, of whom he treats, is in all respects similar to the Jupiter
  of Greece and Rome. He has a father Saturn; and his mother was Rhea. He
  was nursed in Crete; and had wars with the Titans. He dethrones his
  father, who flies to Italy; where he introduces an age of gold. The
  mythology concerning him we find to be in all respects uniform. It is
  therefore to little purpose to substitute another person of the same name
  by way of reconciling matters, unless we can suppose that every person so
  denominated had the same relations and connexions, and the same
  occurrences in life reiterated: which is impossible. It is therefore, I
  think, plain, that the Grecian Deities were not the persons <a
  name="footnotetag406" href="#footnote406"><sup>[406]</sup></a>supposed:
  and that their imputed names were titles. It is true, a very antient and
  respectable writer, <a name="footnotetag407"
  href="#footnote407"><sup>[407]</sup></a>Euhemerus, of whom I have before
  made mention, thought otherwise. It is said, that he could point out
  precisely, where each god departed: and could particularly shew the
  burying-place of Jupiter. Lactantius, who copied from him, says, that it
  was at Cnossus in <a name="footnotetag408"
  href="#footnote408"><sup>[408]</sup></a>Crete. Jupiter, ætate pessum
  actâ, in Cretâ vitam commutavit.&mdash;Sepulchrum ejus est in Cretâ, et
  in oppido Cnosso: et dicitur Vesta hanc urbem creavisse: inque sepulchro
  ejus est inscriptio antiquis literis Græcis, <span title="Zan Kronou" class="grk"
  >&#x396;&#x3B1;&#x3BD; &#x39A;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>.
  If Jupiter had been buried in Crete, as these writers would persuade us,
  the accounts would be uniform about the place where he was deposited.
  Lactantius, we find, and some others, say, that it was in the city
  Cnossus. There are writers who mention it to have been in a cavern upon
  <a name="footnotetag409" href="#footnote409"><sup>[409]</sup></a>Mount
  Ida: others upon Mount <a name="footnotetag410"
  href="#footnote410"><sup>[410]</sup></a>Jasius. Had the Cretans been
  authors of the notion, they would certainly have been more consistent in
  their accounts: but we find no more certainty about the place of his
  burial, than of his birth; concerning which Callimachus could not
  determine.</p>

  <p>He was at times supposed to have been a native of Troas, of Crete, of
  Thebes, of Arcadia, of Elis: but the whole arose from the word <span
  title="taphos" class="grk">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  being, through length of time, misunderstood: for there would have been
  no legend about the birth of Jupiter, had there been no mistake about his
  funeral. It was a common notion of the Magnesians, that Jupiter was
  buried in their country upon Mount Sipylus. Pausanias says, that he
  ascended the mountain, and beheld the tomb, which was well worthy of <a
  name="footnotetag412" href="#footnote412"><sup>[412]</sup></a>admiration.
  The tomb of <a name="footnotetag413"
  href="#footnote413"><sup>[413]</sup></a>Isis in like manner was supposed
  to be at Memphis, and at Philæ in Upper Egypt: also at Nusa in Arabia.
  Osiris was said to have been buried in the same places: likewise at
  Taphosiris, which is thought by Procopius to have had its name, <a
  name="footnotetag414" href="#footnote414"><sup>[414]</sup></a>because it
  was the place of sepulture of Osiris. The same is said of another city,
  which was near the mouth of the Nile, and called Taphosiris parva. But
  they each of them had their name from the worship, and not from the
  interment of the Deity. This is plain from the account given of the <span
  title="taphos Osiridos" class="grk">&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x39F;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or high
  altar of Osiris, by Diodorus; from whom we learn that Busiris and Osiris
  were the same. <a name="footnotetag415"
  href="#footnote415"><sup>[415]</sup></a><i>The Grecians</i>, says this
  author, <i>have a notion, that Busiris in Egypt used to sacrifice
  strangers: not that there was ever such a king as Busiris; but the</i>
  <span title="taphos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, <i>or altar, of Osiris had
  this name in the language of the natives</i>. In short, Busiris was only
  a variation for Osiris: both were compounded of the Egyptian term <a
  name="footnotetag416" href="#footnote416"><sup>[416]</sup></a>Sehor, and
  related to the God of day. Hence the altars of the same Deity were called
  indifferently the altars of Osiris, or Busiris, according as custom
  prevailed.</p>

  <p>I have in a former chapter taken notice of the Tarchons and Dracontia
  in Syria, and other parts: which consisted of sacred ground inclosed with
  a wall, and an altar or two at the upper part. Such an inclosure is
  described by Pausanias, which must have been of great antiquity: hence
  the history of it was very imperfectly known in his time. He is speaking
  of Nemea in Argolis; <a name="footnotetag417"
  href="#footnote417"><sup>[417]</sup></a><i>near which</i>, says he,
  <i>stands the temple of Nemean Jupiter, a structure truly wonderful,
  though the roof is now fallen in. Round the temple is a grove of cypress;
  in which there is a tradition that Opheltes was left by his nurse upon
  the grass, and in her absence killed by a serpent.&mdash;In the same
  place is the tomb of Opheltes, surrounded with a wall of stone; and
  within the inclosure altars. There is also a mound of earth said to be
  the tomb of Lycurgus, the father of Opheltes.</i> Lycurgus is the same as
  Lycus, Lycaon, Lycoreus, the Sun: and Opheltes, his supposed offspring,
  is of the same purport. To say the truth, <a name="footnotetag418"
  href="#footnote418"><sup>[418]</sup></a>Opheltes, or, as it should be
  expressed, Ophel-tin is the place; and Ophel the Deity, Sol Pytho, whose
  symbol was a serpent. Ophel-tin was a Taphos with a <span title="temenos" class="grk"

  inclosure: it was a sacred mound to the Ophite Deity; like that which was
  inclosed and fortified by <a name="footnotetag419"
  href="#footnote419"><sup>[419]</sup></a>Manasseh king of Judah; and which
  had been previously made use of to the same purpose by <a
  name="footnotetag420" href="#footnote420"><sup>[420]</sup></a>Jotham. A
  history similar to that of Opheltes is given of Archemorus; who was said
  to have been left in a garden by his nurse Hypsipyle, and in her absence
  slain by a serpent. Each of them had festivals instituted, together with
  sacred games, in memorial of their misfortune. They are on this account
  by many supposed to have been the same person. But in reality they were
  not persons, but places. They are, however, so far alike, as they are
  terms which relate to the same worship and Deity. Opheltin is the place,
  and altar of the Ophite God above-mentioned: and Archemorus was
  undoubtedly the antient name of the neighbouring town, or city. It is a
  compound of Ar-Chemorus; and signifies the city of Cham-Orus, the same
  who is styled Ophel. In many of these places there was an antient
  tradition of some person having been injured by a serpent in the
  beginning of life; which they have represented as the state of childhood.
  The mythology upon this occasion is different: for sometimes the
  personages spoken of are killed by the serpent: at other times they kill
  it: and there are instances where both histories are told of the same
  person. But whatever may have been the consequence, the history is
  generally made to refer to a state of childhood. Hercules has accordingly
  a conflict with two serpents in his cradle: and Apollo, who was the same
  as Python, was made to engage a serpent of this name at Parnassus, when
  he was a child;</p>

  was supposed to have been stung by a serpent. Æputus was the same as

  Apollo, who is supposed by most to have been victor in his conflict with
  the Pytho, is by Porphyry said to have been slain by that serpent:
  Pythagoras affirmed, that he saw his tomb at Tripos in <a
  name="footnotetag424" href="#footnote424"><sup>[424]</sup></a>Delphi; and
  wrote there an epitaph to his honour. The name of Tripos is said to have
  been given to the place, because the daughters of Triopus used to lament
  there the fate of Apollo. But Apollo and the Python were the same; and
  Tripus, or Triopus, the supposed father of these humane sisters, was a
  variation for Tor-Opus, the serpent-hill, or temple; where neither
  Apollo, nor the Python were slain, but where they were both worshipped,
  being one and the same Deity. <a name="footnotetag425"

  priestesses of the temple; whose business it was to chant hymns in memory
  of the serpent: and what is very remarkable, the festival was originally
  observed upon the seventh <a name="footnotetag426"
  href="#footnote426"><sup>[426]</sup></a>day.</p>

  <p>The Greeks had innumerable monuments of the sort, which I have been
  describing. They were taken for the tombs of departed heroes, but were
  really consecrated places: and the names by which they were
  distinguished, shew plainly their true history. Such was the supposed
  tomb of <a name="footnotetag427"
  href="#footnote427"><sup>[427]</sup></a>Orion at Tanagra, and of
  Phoroneus in <a name="footnotetag428"
  href="#footnote428"><sup>[428]</sup></a>Argolis; the tomb of <a
  name="footnotetag429" href="#footnote429"><sup>[429]</sup></a>Deucalion
  in Athens; and of his wife <a name="footnotetag430"
  href="#footnote430"><sup>[430]</sup></a>Pyrrha in Locris: of <a
  name="footnotetag431" href="#footnote431"><sup>[431]</sup></a>Endymion in
  Elis: of Tityus in <a name="footnotetag432"
  href="#footnote432"><sup>[432]</sup></a>Panopea: of Asterion in the
  island <a name="footnotetag433"
  href="#footnote433"><sup>[433]</sup></a>Lade: of the Egyptian <a
  name="footnotetag434" href="#footnote434"><sup>[434]</sup></a>Belus in
  Achaia. To these may be added the tombs of Zeus in Mount Sipylus, Mount
  Iasius, and Ida: the tombs of Osiris in various parts: and those of Isis,
  which have been enumerated before. Near the Æaceum at Epidaurus was a
  hill, reputed to have been the tomb of the hero <a name="footnotetag435"
  href="#footnote435"><sup>[435]</sup></a>Phocus. This Æaceum was an
  inclosure planted with olive trees of great antiquity; and at a small
  degree above the surface of the ground was an altar sacred to Æacus. To
  divulge the traditions relative to this altar would, it seems, be an high
  profanation. The author, therefore, keeps them a secret. Just before this
  sacred septum was the supposed tomb of Phocus, consisting of a mound of
  raised earth, fenced round with a border of stone work: and a large rough
  stone was placed upon the top of all. Such were the rude monuments of
  Greece, which were looked upon as so many receptacles of the dead: but
  were high altars, with their sacred <span title="temenê" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, which had been
  erected for divine worship in the most early times. The Helladians, and
  the Persians, were of the same <a name="footnotetag436"
  href="#footnote436"><sup>[436]</sup></a>family: hence we find many
  similar rites subsisting among the two nations. The latter adhered to the
  purer Zabaïsm, which they maintained a long time. They erected the same
  sacred Tupha, as the Grecians: and we may be assured of the original
  purpose, for which these hills were raised, from the use to which they
  put them. They were dedicated to the great fountain of light, called by
  the Persians, Anaït: and were set apart as Puratheia, for the celebration
  of the rites of fire. This people, after they had defeated the Sacæ in
  Cappadocia, raised an immense Comah in memorial of their victory. <a
  name="footnotetag437" href="#footnote437"><sup>[437]</sup></a>Strabo, who
  describes it very minutely, tells us, that they chose a spot in an open
  plain; where they reared a Petra, or high place, by heaping up a vast
  mound of earth. This they fashioned to a conical figure; and then
  surrounded it with a wall of stone. In this manner they founded a kind of
  temple in honour of Anaït, Omanus, and Anandrates, the Deities of their
  country. I have mentioned that the Egyptians had hills of this nature:
  and from them the custom was transmitted to Greece. Typhon, or more
  properly Tuphon, <span title="Tuphôn" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C5;&#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, who was supposed to have
  been a giant, was a compound of Tuph-On, as I have before mentioned; and
  signified a sacred <a name="footnotetag438"
  href="#footnote438"><sup>[438]</sup></a>mount of the sun. Those cities in
  Egypt, which had a high place of this sort, and rites in consequence of
  it, were styled Typhonian. Upon such as these they sacrificed red haired
  men, or men with hair of a light colour; in other words strangers. For
  both the sons of Chus, and the Mizraïm were particularly dark and woolly:
  so that there could be no surer mark than the hair to distinguish between
  a native and a foreigner. These sacrifices were offered in the city <a
  name="footnotetag439" href="#footnote439"><sup>[439]</sup></a>Idithia, <a
  name="footnotetag440" href="#footnote440"><sup>[440]</sup></a>Abaris, <a
  name="footnotetag441" href="#footnote441"><sup>[441]</sup></a>Heliopolis,
  and Taphosiris; which in consequence of these offerings were denominated
  Typhonian cities. Many writers say, that these rites were performed to
  Typhon at the <a name="footnotetag442"
  href="#footnote442"><sup>[442]</sup></a>tomb of Osiris. Hence he was in
  later times supposed to have been a person, one of immense size: and he
  was also esteemed a <a name="footnotetag443"
  href="#footnote443"><sup>[443]</sup></a>God. But this arose from the
  common mistake by which places were substituted for the Deities there
  worshipped. Typhon was the Tupha, or altar, the supposed tomb of the God:
  and the offerings were made to the Sun, styled On; the same as Osiris,
  and Busiris. As there were Typhonian mounts in many parts, he was in
  consequence of it supposed to have been buried in different places: near
  mount Caucasus in Colchis; near the river Orontes in Syria; and under
  lake Serbonis. Typhon, or rather Typhonian worship, was not unknown in
  the region of <a name="footnotetag444"
  href="#footnote444"><sup>[444]</sup></a>Troas, near which were the
  Scopuli Typhonis. Plutarch mentions that in the Phrygian Theology Typhon
  was esteemed the grandson of Isaac or Isæac: and says that he was so
  spoken of <span title="en tois Phrugiois" class="grk">&#x3B5;&#x3BD;

  But all terms of relation are to be disregarded. The purport of the
  history was this. The altar was termed Tuphon Isiac, sive <span
  title="Bômos Isiakos" class="grk">&#x392;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x399;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, from the sacra
  Isiaca, which were performed upon it. The same Isaac or Isæac was
  sometimes rendered Æsacus, and supposed to have been a son of the river
  Granicus.</p>

  <p>The antient Arcadians were said to have been the offspring of <a
  name="footnotetag447" href="#footnote447"><sup>[447]</sup></a>Typhon, and
  by some the children of Atlas; by which was meant, that they were people
  of the Typhonian, and Atlantian religion. What they called his tombs were
  certainly mounds of earth, raised very high, like those which have been
  mentioned before: only with this difference, that some of these had lofty
  towers adorned with pinnacles, and battlements. They had also carved upon
  them various symbols; and particularly serpentine hieroglyphics, in
  memorial of the God to whom they were sacred. In their upper story was a
  perpetual fire, which was plainly seen in the night. I have mentioned,
  that the poets formed their notions about Otus and Ephialtes from towers:
  and the idea of Orion's stupendous bulk taken from the Pelorian edifice
  in Sicily. The gigantic stature of Typhon was borrowed from a like
  object: and his character was formed from the hieroglyphical
  representations in the temples styled Typhonian. This may be inferred
  from the allegorical description of Typh&#339;us, given by Hesiod. Typhon
  and Typh&#339;us, were the same personage: and the poet represents him of
  a mixed form, being partly a man, and partly a monstrous dragon, whose
  head consisted of an assemblage of smaller serpents.</p>

  <p>But the noblest description of Typhon is given in some very fine
  poetry by Nonnus. He has taken his ideas from some antient tower situated
  near the sea upon the summit of an high mountain. It was probably the
  Typhonian temple of Zeus upon mount Casius, near the famed Serbonian
  lake. He mentions sad noises heard within, and describes the roaring of
  the surge below: and says that all the monsters of the sea stabled in the
  cavities at the foot of the mountain, which was washed by the ocean.</p>

  <p>It may seem extraordinary, that the worship of the serpent should have
  ever been introduced into the world: and it must appear still more
  remarkable, that it should almost universally have prevailed. As mankind
  are said to have been ruined through the influence of this being, we
  could little expect that it would, of all other objects, have been
  adopted, as the most sacred and salutary symbol; and rendered the chief
  object of <a name="footnotetag451"
  href="#footnote451"><sup>[451]</sup></a>adoration. Yet so we find it to
  have been. In most of the antient rites there is some allusion to the <a
  name="footnotetag452" href="#footnote452"><sup>[452]</sup></a>serpent. I
  have taken notice, that in the Orgies of Bacchus, the persons who partook
  of the ceremony used to carry serpents in their hands, and with horrid
  screams called upon Eva, Eva. They were often crowned with <a
  name="footnotetag453" href="#footnote453"><sup>[453]</sup></a>serpents,
  and still made the same frantic exclamation. One part of the mysterious
  rites of Jupiter Sabazius was to let a snake slip down the bosom of the
  person to be initiated, which was taken out below<a name="footnotetag454"
  href="#footnote454"><sup>[454]</sup></a>. These ceremonies, and this
  symbolic worship, began among the Magi, who were the sons of Chus: and by
  them they were propagated in various parts. Epiphanius thinks, that the
  invocation, Eva, Eva, related to the great <a name="footnotetag455"
  href="#footnote455"><sup>[455]</sup></a>mother of mankind, who was
  deceived by the serpent: and Clemens of Alexandria is of the same
  opinion. He supposes, that by this term was meant <a

  was very fond of these Orgies, in which the serpent was introduced.
  Plutarch mentions, that rites of this sort were practised by the Edonian
  women near mount Hæmus in Thrace; and carried on to a degree of madness.
  Olympias copied them closely in all their frantic man&#339;uvres. She
  used to be followed with many attendants, who had each a thyrsus with <a
  name="footnotetag459" href="#footnote459"><sup>[459]</sup></a>serpents
  twined round it. They had also snakes in their hair, and in the chaplets,
  which they wore; so that they made a most fearful appearance. Their cries
  were very shocking: and the whole was attended with a continual
  repetition of the words, <a name="footnotetag460"
  href="#footnote460"><sup>[460]</sup></a>Evoe, Saboe, Hues Attes, Attes
  Hues, which were titles of the God Dionusus. He was peculiarly named
  <span title="Huês" class="grk">&#x1F59;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>; and his

  <p>In Egypt was a serpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as very
  sacred; and the natives are said to have made use of it as a royal tiara,
  with which they ornamented the statues of <a name="footnotetag462"
  href="#footnote462"><sup>[462]</sup></a>Isis. We learn from Diodorus
  Siculus, that the kings of Egypt wore high bonnets, which terminated in a
  round ball: and the whole was surrounded with figures of <a
  name="footnotetag463" href="#footnote463"><sup>[463]</sup></a>asps. The
  priests likewise upon their bonnets had the representation of serpents.
  The antients had a notion, that when Saturn devoured his own children,
  his wife Ops deceived him by substituting a large stone in lieu of one of
  his sons, which stone was called Abadir. But Ops, and Opis, represented
  here as a feminine, was the serpent Deity, and Abadir is the same
  personage under a different denomination. <a name="footnotetag464"
  href="#footnote464"><sup>[464]</sup></a>Abadir Deus est; et hoc nomine
  lapis ille, quem Saturnus dicitur devorâsse pro Jove, quem Græci <span

  >&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. Abadir
  seems to be a variation of Ob-Adur, and signifies the serpent God Orus.
  One of these stones, which Saturn was supposed to have swallowed instead
  of a child, stood, according to <a name="footnotetag465"
  href="#footnote465"><sup>[465]</sup></a>Pausanias, at Delphi. It was
  esteemed very sacred, and used to have libations of wine poured upon it
  daily; and upon festivals was otherwise honoured. The purport of the
  above history I imagine to have been this. It was for a long time a
  custom to offer children at the altar of Saturn: but in process of time
  they removed it, and in its room erected a <span title="stulos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or stone pillar;
  before which they made their vows, and offered sacrifices of another
  nature. This stone, which they thus substituted, was called Ab-Adar, from
  the Deity represented by it. The term Ab generally signifies a <a
  name="footnotetag466" href="#footnote466"><sup>[466]</sup></a>father:
  but, in this instance, it certainly relates to a serpent, which was
  indifferently styled Ab, Aub, and <a name="footnotetag467"
  href="#footnote467"><sup>[467]</sup></a>Ob. I take Abadon, or, as it is
  mentioned in the Revelations, Abaddon, to have been the name of the same
  Ophite God, with whose worship the world had been so long infected. He is
  termed by the Evangelist <a name="footnotetag468"
  href="#footnote468"><sup>[468]</sup></a><span title="Abaddôn, ton Angelon tês Abussou" class="grk"

  is described as the <a name="footnotetag469"
  href="#footnote469"><sup>[469]</sup></a>dragon, that old serpent, which
  is the devil, and Satan. Hence I think, that the learned Heinsius is very
  right in the opinion, which he has given upon this passage; when he makes
  Abaddon the same as the serpent Pytho. Non dubitandum est, quin Pythius

  <p>It is said, that, in the ritual of Zoroaster, the great expanse of the
  heavens, and even nature itself, was described under the symbol of a
  serpent<a name="footnotetag471" href="#footnote471"><sup>[471]</sup></a>.
  The like was mentioned in the Octateuch of Ostanes: and moreover, that in
  Persis and in other parts of the east they erected temples to the serpent
  tribe, and held festivals to their honour, esteeming them <a

  supreme of all Gods, and the superintendants of the whole world</i>. The
  worship began among the people of Chaldea. They built the city Opis upon
  the <a name="footnotetag473"
  href="#footnote473"><sup>[473]</sup></a>Tigris, and were greatly addicted
  to divination, and to the worship of the serpent<a name="footnotetag474"
  href="#footnote474"><sup>[474]</sup></a>. Inventi sunt ex iis (Chaldeis)
  augures, et magi, divinatores, et sortilegi, et inquirentes Ob, et
  Ideoni. From Chaldea the worship passed into Egypt, where the serpent
  Deity was called Can-oph, Can-eph, and C'neph. It had also the name of
  Ob, or Oub, and was the same as the Basiliscus, or Royal Serpent; the
  same also as the Thermuthis: and in like manner was made use of by way of
  ornament to the statues of their <a name="footnotetag475"
  href="#footnote475"><sup>[475]</sup></a>Gods. The chief Deity of Egypt is
  said to have been Vulcan, who was also styled Opas, as we learn from <a
  name="footnotetag476" href="#footnote476"><sup>[476]</sup></a>Cicero. He
  was the same as Osiris, the Sun; and hence was often called Ob-El, sive
  Pytho Sol: and there were pillars sacred to him with curious
  hieroglyphical inscriptions, which had the same name. They were very
  lofty, and narrow in comparison of their length; hence among the Greeks,
  who copied from the Egyptians, every thing gradually tapering to a point
  was styled Obelos, and Obeliscus. Ophel (Oph-El) was a name of the same
  purport: and I have shewn, that many sacred mounds, or Tapha, were thus
  denominated from the serpent Deity, to whom they were sacred.</p>

  <p>Sanchoniathon makes mention of an history, which he once wrote upon
  the worship of the serpent. The title of this work, according to Eusebius
  was, <a name="footnotetag477"
  href="#footnote477"><sup>[477]</sup></a>Ethothion, or Ethothia. Another
  treatise upon the same subject was written by Pherecydes Syrus, which was
  probably a copy of the former; for he is said to have composed it, <a
  name="footnotetag478" href="#footnote478"><sup>[478]</sup></a><span

  &#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, <i>from some
  previous accounts of the Phenicians</i>. The title of his book was the
  Theology of Ophion, styled Ophioneus; and of his worshippers, called
  Ophionidæ. Thoth, and Athoth, were certainly titles of the Deity in the
  Gentile world: and the book of Sanchoniathon might very possibly have
  been from hence named Ethothion, or more truly Athothion. But from the
  subject, upon which it was written, as well as from the treatise of
  Pherecydes, I should think, that Athothion, or Ethothion, was a mistake
  for Ath-ophion, a title which more immediately related to that worship,
  of which the writer treated. <i>Ath</i> was a sacred title, as I have
  shewn: and I imagine, that this dissertation did not barely relate to the
  serpentine Deity; but contained accounts of his votaries, the Ophitæ, the
  principal of which were the sons of Chus. The worship of the Serpent
  began among them; and they were from thence denominated Ethopians, and
  Aithopians, which the Greeks rendered <span title="Aithiopes" class="grk"
  >&#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>. It was
  a name, which they did not receive from their complexion, as has been
  commonly surmised; for the branch of Phut, and the Lubim, were probably
  of a deeper die: but they were so called from Ath-Ope, and Ath-Opis, the
  God which they worshipped. This may be proved from Pliny. He says that
  the country Æthiopia (and consequently the people) had the name of Æthiop
  from a personage who was a Deity&mdash;ab <a name="footnotetag479"
  href="#footnote479"><sup>[479]</sup></a>Æthiope Vulcani filio. The
  Æthiopes brought these rites into Greece: and called the island, where
  they first established them, <a name="footnotetag480"
  href="#footnote480"><sup>[480]</sup></a>Ellopia, Solis Serpentis insula.
  It was the same as Eub&#339;a, a name of the like purport; in which
  island was a region named Æthiopium. Eub&#339;a is properly Oub-Aia; and
  signifies the Serpent Island. The same worship prevailed among the
  Hyperboreans, as we may judge from the names of the sacred women, who
  used to come annually to Delos. They were priestesses of the Tauric
  Goddess, and were denominated from her titles.</p>

  <p>Hercules was esteemed the chief God, the same as Chronus; and was said
  to have produced the Mundane egg. He was represented in the Orphic
  Theology under the mixed symbol of a <a name="footnotetag482"
  href="#footnote482"><sup>[482]</sup></a>lion and serpent: and sometimes
  of a <a name="footnotetag483"
  href="#footnote483"><sup>[483]</sup></a>serpent only. I have before
  mentioned, that the Cuthites under the title of Heliadæ settled at
  Rhodes: and, as they were <a name="207"></a>Hivites or Ophites, that the
  island in consequence of it was of old named Ophiusa. There was likewise
  a tradition, that it had once swarmed with <a name="footnotetag484"
  href="#footnote484"><sup>[484]</sup></a>serpents. The like notion
  prevailed almost in every place, where they settled. They came under the
  more general titles of Leleges and Pelasgi: but more particularly of
  Elopians, Europians, Oropians, Asopians, Inopians, Ophionians, and
  Æthiopes, as appears from the names, which they bequeathed; and in most
  places, where they resided, there were handed down traditions, which
  alluded to their original title of Ophites. In Phrygia, and upon the
  Hellespont, whither they sent out colonies very early, was a people
  styled <span title="Ophiogeneis" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  or the serpent-breed; who were said to retain an affinity and
  correspondence with <a name="footnotetag485"
  href="#footnote485"><sup>[485]</sup></a>serpents. And a notion prevailed,
  that some hero, who had conducted them, was changed from a serpent to a
  man. In Colchis was a river Ophis; and there was another of the same name
  in Arcadia. It was so named from a body of people, who settled upon its
  banks, and were said to have been conducted by a serpent: <a

  Thucydides mentions a people of Ætolia called <a name="footnotetag488"
  href="#footnote488"><sup>[488]</sup></a>Ophionians: and the temple of
  Apollo at Patara in Lycia seems to have had its first institution from a
  priestess of the same <a name="footnotetag489"
  href="#footnote489"><sup>[489]</sup></a>name. The island of Cyprus was
  styled Ophiusa, and Ophiodes, from the serpents, with which it was
  supposed to have <a name="footnotetag490"
  href="#footnote490"><sup>[490]</sup></a>abounded. Of what species they
  were is no where mentioned; excepting only that about Paphos there was

  this is meant the Ophite race, who came from Egypt, and from Syria, and
  got footing in this <a name="footnotetag492"
  href="#footnote492"><sup>[492]</sup></a>island. They settled also in

  The Athenians were esteemed Serpentigenæ; and they had a tradition, that

  <i>being formed with the body of a man blended with that of a

  Athenians inexplicable: yet he labours to explain it, by representing
  Cecrops, as half a man, and half a <a name="footnotetag503"
  href="#footnote503"><sup>[503]</sup></a>brute; because he had been of two
  different communities. Eustathius likewise tries to solve it nearly upon
  the same principles, and with the like success. Some had mentioned of
  Cecrops, that he underwent a metamorphosis, <a name="footnotetag504"

  the rudeness and barbarity of his <a name="footnotetag505"
  href="#footnote505"><sup>[505]</sup></a>country, and became more
  civilized and humane. This is too high a compliment to be payed to Greece
  in its infant state, and detracts greatly from the character of the

  I think, easily account for it. Cecrops was certainly a title of the
  Deity, who was worshipped under this <a name="footnotetag507"
  href="#footnote507"><sup>[507]</sup></a>emblem. Something of the like
  nature was mentioned of Triptolemus, and <a name="footnotetag508"
  href="#footnote508"><sup>[508]</sup></a>Ericthonius: and the like has
  been said above of Hercules. The natives of Thebes in B&#339;otia, like
  the Athenians above, esteemed themselves of the serpent race. The
  Lacedæmonians likewise referred themselves to the same original. Their
  city is said of old to have swarmed with <a name="footnotetag509"
  href="#footnote509"><sup>[509]</sup></a>serpents. The same is said of the
  city Amyclæ in Italy, which was of Spartan original. They came hither in
  such abundance, that it was abandoned by the <a name="footnotetag510"
  href="#footnote510"><sup>[510]</sup></a>inhabitants. Argos was infested
  in the same manner, till Apis came from Egypt, and settled in that city.
  He was a prophet, the reputed son of Apollo, and a person of great skill
  and sagacity. To him they attributed the blessing of having their country
  freed from this evil.</p>

  <p>Thus the Argives gave the credit to this imaginary personage of
  clearing their land of this grievance: but the brood came from the very
  quarter from whence Apis was supposed to have arrived. They were
  certainly Hivites from Egypt: and the same story is told of that country.
  It is represented as having been of old over-run with serpents; and
  almost depopulated through their numbers. Diodorus Siculus seems to
  understand this <a name="footnotetag512"
  href="#footnote512"><sup>[512]</sup></a>literally: but a region, which
  was annually overflowed, and that too for so long a season, could not
  well be liable to such a calamity. They were serpents of another nature,
  with which it was thus infested: and the history relates to the Cuthites,
  the original Ophitæ, who for a long time possessed that country. They
  passed from Egypt to Syria, and to the Euphrates: and mention is made of
  a particular breed of serpents upon that river, which were harmless to
  the natives, but fatal to every body else. <a name="footnotetag513"
  href="#footnote513"><sup>[513]</sup></a>This, I think, cannot be
  understood literally. The wisdom of the serpent may be great; but not
  sufficient to make these distinctions. These serpents were of the same
  nature as the <a name="footnotetag514"
  href="#footnote514"><sup>[514]</sup></a>birds of Diomedes, and the dogs
  in the temple of Vulcan: and these histories relate to Ophite priests,
  who used to spare their own people, and sacrifice strangers, a custom
  which prevailed at one time in most parts of the world. I have mentioned
  that the Cuthite priests were very learned: and as they were Ophites,
  whoever had the advantage of their information, was said to have been
  instructed by serpents. Hence there was a tradition, that Melampus was
  rendered prophetic from a communication with these <a
  name="footnotetag515" href="#footnote515"><sup>[515]</sup></a>animals.
  Something similar is said of Tiresias.</p>

  <p>As the worship of the serpent was of old so prevalent, many places, as
  well as people from thence, received their names. Those who settled in
  Campania were called Opici; which some would have changed to Ophici;
  because they were denominated from serpents. <a name="footnotetag516"
  href="#footnote516"><sup>[516]</sup></a><span title="Oi de (phasin) hoti Ophikoi apo tôn ophiôn." class="grk"

  &#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;.</span> But they are, in reality,
  both names of the same purport, and denote the origin of the people. We
  meet with places called Opis, Ophis, Ophitæa, Ophionia, Ophioëssa,
  Ophiodes, and Ophiusa. This last was an antient name, by which, according
  to Stephanus, the islands Rhodes, Cythnus, Besbicus, Tenos, and the whole
  continent of Africa, were distinguished. There were also cities so
  called. Add to these places denominated Oboth, Obona, and reversed Onoba,
  from Ob, which was of the same purport. Clemens Alexandrinus says, that
  the term Eva signified a serpent, if pronounced with a proper <a
  name="footnotetag517" href="#footnote517"><sup>[517]</sup></a>aspirate.
  We find that there were places of this name. There was a city Eva in <a
  name="footnotetag518" href="#footnote518"><sup>[518]</sup></a>Arcadia:
  and another in <a name="footnotetag519"
  href="#footnote519"><sup>[519]</sup></a>Macedonia. There was also a
  mountain Eva, or Evan, taken notice of by <a name="footnotetag520"
  href="#footnote520"><sup>[520]</sup></a>Pausanias, between which and
  Ithome lay the city Messene. He mentions also an Eva in <a
  name="footnotetag521" href="#footnote521"><sup>[521]</sup></a>Argolis,
  and speaks of it as a large town. Another name for a serpent, of which I
  have as yet taken no notice, was Patan, or Pitan. Many places in
  different parts were denominated from this term. Among others was a city
  in <a name="footnotetag522"
  href="#footnote522"><sup>[522]</sup></a>Laconia; and another in <a
  name="footnotetag523" href="#footnote523"><sup>[523]</sup></a>Mysia,
  which Stephanus styles a city of Æolia. They were undoubtedly so named
  from the worship of the serpent, Pitan: and had probably Dracontia, where
  were figures and devices relative to the religion which prevailed. Ovid
  mentions the latter city, and has some allusions to its antient history,
  when he describes Medea as flying through the air from Attica to
  Colchis.</p>

  <p>The city was situated upon the river Eva or Evan, which the Greeks
  rendered <a name="footnotetag525"
  href="#footnote525"><sup>[525]</sup></a>Evenus. It is remarkable, that
  the Opici, who are said to have been denominated from serpents, had also
  the name of Pitanatæ: at least one part of that family were so called. <a

  is a term of the same purport as Opici, and relates to the votaries of
  Pitan, the serpent Deity, which was adored by that people.</p>

  <p>Menelaus was of old styled <a name="footnotetag527"
  href="#footnote527"><sup>[527]</sup></a>Pitanates, as we learn from
  Hesychius: and the reason of it may be known from his being a Spartan, by
  which was intimated one of the serpentigenæ, or Ophites. Hence he was
  represented with a serpent for a device upon his shield. It is said that
  a brigade, or portion of infantry, was among some of the Greeks named <a
  name="footnotetag528" href="#footnote528"><sup>[528]</sup></a>Pitanates;
  and the soldiers, in consequence of it, must have been termed Pitanatæ:
  undoubtedly, because they had the Pitan, or serpent, for their <a
  name="footnotetag529" href="#footnote529"><sup>[529]</sup></a>standard.
  Analogous to this, among other nations, there were soldiers called <a
  name="footnotetag530" href="#footnote530"><sup>[530]</sup></a>Draconarii.
  I believe, that in most countries the military standard was an emblem of
  the Deity there worshipped.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, I hope, that I have thrown some light upon
  the history of this primitive idolatry: and have moreover shewn, that
  wherever any of these Ophite colonies settled they left behind from their
  rites and institutes, as well as from the names, which they bequeathed to
  places, ample memorials, by which they may be clearly traced out. It may
  seem strange, that in the first ages there should have been such an
  universal defection from the truth; and above all things such a
  propensity to this particular mode of worship, this mysterious attachment
  to the serpent. What is scarce credible, it obtained among Christians;
  and one of the most early heresies in the church was of this sort,
  introduced by a sect, called by <a name="footnotetag531"
  href="#footnote531"><sup>[531]</sup></a>Epiphanius Ophitæ, by <a
  name="footnotetag532" href="#footnote532"><sup>[532]</sup></a>Clemens of
  Alexandria Ophiani. They are particularly described by Tertullian, whose
  account of them is well worth our notice. <a name="footnotetag533"
  href="#footnote533"><sup>[533]</sup></a>Accesserunt his Hæretici etiam
  illi, qui Ophitæ nuncupantur: nam serpentem magnificant in tantum, ut
  illum etiam ipsi Christo præferant. Ipse enim, inquiunt, scientiæ nobis
  boni et mali originem dedit. Hujus animadvertens potentiam et majestatem
  Moyses æreum posuit serpentem: et quicunque in eum aspexerunt, sanitatem
  consecuti sunt. Ipse, aiunt, præterea in Evangelio imitatur serpentis
  ipsius sacram potestatem, dicendo, et sicut Moyses exaltavit serpentem in
  deserto, ita exaltari oportet filium hominis. Ipsum introducunt ad
  benedicenda Eucharistia sua. In the above we see plainly the perverseness
  of human wit, which deviates so industriously; and is ever after employed
  in finding expedients to countenance error, and render apostasy
  plausible. It would be a noble undertaking, and very edifying in its
  consequences, if some person of true learning, and a deep insight into
  antiquity, would go through with the history of the <a
  name="footnotetag534" href="#footnote534"><sup>[534]</sup></a>serpent. I
  have adopted it, as far as it relates to my system, which is, in some
  degree, illustrated by it.</p>

  Thucydides. l. 6. p. 378.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thucydides acquaints us concerning the Cyclopes and Læstrygones, that
  they were the most antient inhabitants of Sicily, but that he could not
  find out their race: nor did he know from what part of the world they
  originally came, nor to what country they afterwards betook themselves. I
  may appear presumptuous in pretending to determine a history so remote
  and obscure; and which was a secret to this learned Grecian two thousand
  years ago. Yet this is my present purpose: and I undertake it with a
  greater confidence, as I can plainly shew, that we have many lights, with
  which the natives of Hellas were unacquainted; besides many advantages,
  of which they would not avail themselves.</p>

  <p>The gigantic Cyclopes were originally Ophitæ, who worshipped the
  symbolical serpent. They have been represented by the poets, as persons
  of an enormous <a name="footnotetag535"
  href="#footnote535"><sup>[535]</sup></a>stature, rude and savage in their
  demeanour, and differing from the rest of mankind in countenance. They
  are described as having only one large eye; which is said to have been
  placed, contrary to the usual situation of that organ, in the middle of
  their foreheads. Their place of residence was upon mount Ætna, and in the
  adjacent district at the foot of that <a name="footnotetag536"
  href="#footnote536"><sup>[536]</sup></a>mountain, which was the original
  region styled Trinacia. This is the common account, as it has been
  transmitted by the Poets, as well as by the principal mythologists of
  Greece: and in this we have been taught to acquiesce. But the real
  history is not so obvious and superficial. There are accounts of them to
  be obtained, that differ much from the representations which are commonly
  exhibited. The Poets have given a mixed description: and in lieu of the
  Deity of the place have introduced these strange personages, the ideas of
  whose size were borrowed from sacred edifices, where the Deity was
  worshipped. They were Petra, or temples of C&#339;lus; of the same nature
  and form as the tower of Orion, which was at no great distance from them.
  Some of them had the name of <a name="footnotetag537"
  href="#footnote537"><sup>[537]</sup></a>Charon, and Tarchon: and they
  were esteemed Pelorian, from the God Alorus, the same as C&#339;lus and
  Python. The Grecians confounded the people, who raised these buildings,
  with the structures themselves. Strabo places them near <a
  name="footnotetag538" href="#footnote538"><sup>[538]</sup></a>Ætna, and
  Leontina: and supposes, that they once ruled over that part of the
  island. And it is certain that a people styled Cyclopians did possess
  that <a name="footnotetag539"
  href="#footnote539"><sup>[539]</sup></a>province. Polyphemus is imagined
  to have been the chief of this people: and Euripides describes the place
  of his residence as towards the foot of the mountain: <a
  name="footnotetag540" href="#footnote540"><sup>[540]</sup></a><span
  title="Oikeis hup' Aitnêi têi purostaktôi Petrai" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x1F51;&#x3C0;'
  &#x391;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BD;&#x1FC3; &#x3C4;&#x1FC3;
  &#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x1FF3;
  &#x3A0;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x1FB3;</span>. They are represented as a
  people savage, and lawless, and delighting in human flesh. Hence it is
  prophesied by Cassandra, as a curse upon Ulysses, that he would one day
  be forced to seek for refuge in a Cyclopian <a name="footnotetag541"
  href="#footnote541"><sup>[541]</sup></a>mansion. And when he arrives
  under the roof of Polyphemus, and makes inquiry about his host, and
  particularly upon what he fed; he is told, that the Cyclops above all
  things esteemed the flesh of strangers. <a name="footnotetag542"
  href="#footnote542"><sup>[542]</sup></a>Chance never throws any body upon
  this coast, says Silenus, but he is made a meal of; and it is looked upon
  as a delicious repast. This character of the Cyclopians arose from the
  cruel custom of sacrificing strangers, whom fortune brought upon their
  coast. This was practised in many parts of the world, but especially
  here, and upon the coast of the Lamii in Italy; and among all the Scythic
  nations upon the Euxine sea: into all which regions it was introduced
  from Egypt and Canaan.</p>

  <p>But we must not consider the Cyclopians in this partial light: nor
  look for them only in the island of Sicily, to which they have been by
  the Poets confined. Memorials of them are to be found in many parts of
  Greece, where they were recorded as far superior to the natives in
  science and ingenuity. The Grecians, by not distinguishing between the
  Deity, and the people, who were called by his titles, have brought great
  confusion upon this history. The Cyclopians were denominated from <span
  title="Kuklôps" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C8;</span>, Cyclops, the same as
  C&#339;lus. According to Parmeno Byzantinus, he was the God <a
  name="footnotetag543" href="#footnote543"><sup>[543]</sup></a>Nilus of
  Egypt, who was the same as <a name="footnotetag544"
  href="#footnote544"><sup>[544]</sup></a>Zeus, and Osiris. The history
  both of the Deity, and of the people, became in time obsolete: and it has
  been rendered more obscure by the mixed manner in which it has been
  represented by the Poets.</p>

  <p>It is generally agreed by writers upon the subject, that the
  Cyclopians were of a size superior to the common race of mankind. Among
  the many tribes of the Amonians, which went abroad, were to be found
  people, who were styled <a name="footnotetag545"
  href="#footnote545"><sup>[545]</sup></a>Anakim, and were descended from
  the sons of Anac: so that this history, though carried to a great excess,
  was probably founded in truth. They were particularly famous for
  architecture; which they introduced into Greece, as we are told by <a
  name="footnotetag546" href="#footnote546"><sup>[546]</sup></a>Herodotus:
  and in all parts, whither they came, they erected noble structures, which
  were remarkable for their height and beauty: and were often dedicated to
  the chief Deity, the Sun, under the name of Elorus, and P'elorus. People
  were so struck with their grandeur, that they called every thing great
  and stupendous, Pelorian. And when they described the Cyclopians as a
  lofty towering race, they came at last to borrow their ideas of this
  people from the towers, to which they alluded. They supposed them in
  height to reach to the clouds; and in bulk to equal the promontories, on
  which they were founded. Homer says of Polyphemus,</p>

  <p>As these buildings were oftentimes light-houses, and had in their
  upper story one round casement, Argolici clypeï, aut Ph&#339;beæ lampadis
  instar, by which they afforded light in the night-season; the Greeks made
  this a characteristic of the people. They supposed this aperture to have
  been an eye, which was fiery, and glaring, and placed in the middle of

  <p>The Grecians have so confounded the Cyclopian Deity with his votaries,
  that it is difficult to speak precisely of either. They sometimes mention
  him as a single person; the same as Nilus of Egypt, who was esteemed the
  father of the Gods. At other times they introduce a plurality, whom they
  still represent as of the highest antiquity, and make the brethren of
  Cronus: <a name="footnotetag550"

  C&#339;lus. But in these histories every degree of relation has been
  founded upon idle surmises: and is uniformly to be set aside. The
  Cyclopian Deity was <a name="footnotetag552"
  href="#footnote552"><sup>[552]</sup></a>Ouranus, and the Cyclopians were
  his priests and votaries: some of whom had divine honours paid to them,
  and were esteemed as Gods. Upon the Isthmus of Corinth was an antient
  temple; which seems to have been little more than a <span title="taphos" class="grk"

  offerings were made to the Cyclopian <a name="footnotetag553"

  <p>But there is no reason to think, that the city Hupereia was in Sicily;
  or that the Pheacians came from that country. The notion arose from a
  common mistake. All the Greek and Roman Poets, and even Strabo, with
  other respectable writers, have taken it for granted, that the Cyclopians
  of Homer were near Ætna in Sicily. Others except to their being near
  Ætna; and insist, that they were in the vicinity of Eryx upon the
  opposite part of the island. But Homer does not once mention the island
  during his whole account of the Cyclopes: nor does Ulysses arrive in
  Sicily, till after many subsequent adventures. That there were Cyclopians
  near Ætna is certain: but those mentioned by Homer were of another
  country, and are represented as natives of the continent though his
  account is very indeterminate and obscure. There were probably people of
  this family in many parts of Sicily, especially about the city Camarina.
  They seem to have been of the Anakim race, and worshippers of the Sun.
  Hence they were styled Camarin, and their chief city Camarina, which was
  so called from a city of the same name in <a name="footnotetag555"
  href="#footnote555"><sup>[555]</sup></a>Chaldea, the Ur of the
  Scriptures. Polyphemus is mentioned as a musician and a shepherd; but of
  a savage and brutal disposition: which character arose from the cruel
  rites practised by the Cyclopians. According to <a name="footnotetag556"
  href="#footnote556"><sup>[556]</sup></a>Bacchylides it was said, that
  Galatus, Illyrius, and Celtus were the sons of Polyphemus. By this was
  certainly signified, that the Galatæ, Illyrii, and Celtæ, were of
  Cyclopian original, and of the Anakim race; all equally Amonians.
  Lycophron mentions the cave of this personage, by which was meant an
  antient temple; and he calls it <a name="footnotetag557"
  href="#footnote557"><sup>[557]</sup></a><span title="monoglênou stegas Charônos" class="grk"

  &#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>: <i>the
  habitation of Charon, a personage with one eye</i>. But here, as I have
  often observed, the place is mistaken for a person; the temple for the
  Deity. Charon was the very place; the antient temple of the Sun. It was
  therefore styled Char-On from the God, who was there worshipped; and
  after the Egyptian custom an eye was engraved over its portal. These
  temples were sometimes called Charis, <a name="footnotetag558"
  href="#footnote558"><sup>[558]</sup></a><span title="Charis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>; which is a compound of
  Char-Is, and signifies a prutaneion, or place sacred to Hephastus. As the
  rites of fire were once almost universally practised, there were many
  places of this name, especially in <a name="footnotetag559"
  href="#footnote559"><sup>[559]</sup></a>Parthia, Babylonia, and Phrygia.
  The Grecians rendered Char-Is by <span title="Charis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, a term in their own
  language, which signified grace and elegance. And nothing witnesses their
  attachment to antient terms more than their continually introducing them,
  though they were strangers to their true meaning. The Arimaspians were
  Hyperborean Cyclopians; and had temples named Charis, or Charisia, in the
  top of which were preserved a perpetual fire. They were of the same
  family as those of <a name="footnotetag560"
  href="#footnote560"><sup>[560]</sup></a>Sicily, and had the same rites;
  and particularly worshipped the Ophite Deity under the name of <a
  name="footnotetag561" href="#footnote561"><sup>[561]</sup></a>Opis.
  Aristeas Proconnesius wrote their history; and among other things
  mentioned that they had but one eye, which was placed in their graceful
  forehead.</p>

  <p>How could the front of a Cyclopian, one of the most hideous monsters
  that ever poetic fancy framed, be styled graceful? The whole is a mistake
  of terms: and what this writer had misapplied, related to Charis, a
  tower; and the eye was the casement in the top of the edifice, where a
  light, and fire were kept up. What confirmed the mistake was the
  representation of an eye, which, as I have mentioned, was often engraved
  over the entrance of these temples. The chief Deity of Egypt was
  frequently represented under the symbol of an eye, <a
  name="footnotetag563" href="#footnote563"><sup>[563]</sup></a>and a
  sceptre. I have observed, that Orion was supposed to have had three
  fathers, merely because a tower, sacred to him in Sicily, and called
  Tor-Pator, was altered to <span title="Tripatôr" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;</span>; which
  change seemed to countenance such an opinion. The Cyclopians were of the
  same region in that island; and their towers had undoubtedly the same
  name: for the Cyclopians were styled <a name="footnotetag564"
  href="#footnote564"><sup>[564]</sup></a><span title="Tritopateres" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>,
  and were supposed to have been three in number. Some such mistake was
  made about the towers styled Charis: whence the Grecians formed their
  notion of the Graces. As Charis was a tower sacred to fire; some of the
  Poets have supposed a nymph of that name, who was beloved by Vulcan.
  Homer speaks of her as his wife: <a name="footnotetag565"
  href="#footnote565"><sup>[565]</sup></a><span title="Charis&mdash;Kalê, hên ôpuie periklutos Amphiguneis." class="grk"

  <p>The Graces were said to be related to the Sun who was in reality the
  same as Vulcan. The Sun among the people of the east was called Hares,
  and with a guttural, Chares: and his temple was styled Tor-Chares. But as
  Tor-Pator was changed to Tripator; so Tor-Chares was rendered Trichares,
  which the Greeks expressed <span title="Tricharis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>; and
  from thence formed a notion of three Graces. Cicero says, that they were
  the daughters of night, and Erebus: but Antimachus, more agreeably to
  this etymology, maintained, that they were the offspring of the Sun and
  light; <a name="footnotetag567"

  These seeming contradictions are not difficult to be reconciled.</p>

  <p>The Amonians, wherever they settled, were celebrated for their
  superiority in science; and particularly for their skill in building. Of
  this family were Trophonius, and his brother Agamedes, who are
  represented as very great in the profession. They were truly wonderful,
  says <a name="footnotetag568"
  href="#footnote568"><sup>[568]</sup></a>Pausanias, for the temples, which
  they erected to the Gods; and for the stately edifices, which they built
  for men. They were the architects, who contrived the temple of Apollo at
  Delphi, and the treasury constructed to Urius. They were, I make no
  doubt, some of those, who were styled Cyclopians; as the people under
  this appellation were far the most eminent in this way. When the Sibyl in
  Virgil shews Æneas the place of torment in the shades below, and leads
  him through many melancholy recesses, we find that the whole was
  separated from the regions of bliss by a wall built by the Cyclopians.
  The Sibyl accordingly at their exit tells him,</p>

  </div>
  <p>From hence we find that they were the reputed builders of the infernal
  mansions; which notion arose from the real buildings, which they erected.
  For all the ideas of the antients about the infernal regions, and the
  torments of hell, were taken from the temples in each country; and from
  the rites and inquisition practised in them. But the Cyclopians were not
  merely imaginary operators. They founded several cities in Greece; and
  constructed many temples to the Gods, which were of old in high repute.
  They were so much esteemed for their skill, that, as the Scholiast upon
  Statius observes, every thing great and noble was looked upon as
  Cyclopian: <a name="footnotetag570"
  href="#footnote570"><sup>[570]</sup></a>quicquid magnitudine suâ nobile
  est, Cyclopum manu dicitur fabricatum. Nor was this a fiction, as may be
  surmised; for they were in great measure the real architects. And if, in
  the room of those portentous beings the Cyclopes, <span title="Kuklôpes" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>, we
  substitute a colony of people called Cyclopians, we shall find the whole
  to be true, which is attributed to them; and a new field of history will
  be opened, that was before unknown. They were, undoubtedly, a part of the
  people styled Academians, who resided in Attica; where they founded the
  Academia, and Ceramicus, and introduced human sacrifices. Hence we are
  informed, that the Athenians, in the time of a plague, sacrificed three
  virgin daughters of Hyacinthus at the tomb Geræstus, the <a
  name="footnotetag571" href="#footnote571"><sup>[571]</sup></a>Cyclops.
  But Geræstus was not a person, but a place. <span title="Geraistos" class="grk"
  >&#x393;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  is a small variation for Ker-Astus; and signifies the temple of Astus the
  God of fire. It was certainly the antient name of the place where these
  sacrifices were exhibited: and the Taphos was a Cyclopian altar, upon
  which they were performed. The Cyclopians are said to have built the
  antient city Mycene, which Hercules in Seneca threatens to ruin.</p>

  <p>All these poetical histories were founded in original truths. Some of
  them built Hermione, one of the most antient cities in Greece. The
  tradition was, that it was built by <a name="footnotetag576"
  href="#footnote576"><sup>[576]</sup></a>Hermion the son of Europs, or
  Europis, a descendant of Phoroneus, and Niobe; and was inhabited by
  Dorians, who came from Argos: in which history is more than at first
  appears. The city stood near a stagnant lake, and a deep cavern; where
  was supposed to be the most compendious passage to the shades below: <a
  name="footnotetag577" href="#footnote577"><sup>[577]</sup></a><span

  &#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;.</span> The lake
  was called the pool of Acherusia; near to which and the yawning cavern
  the Cyclopians chose to take up their habitation. They are said to have
  built <a name="footnotetag578"
  href="#footnote578"><sup>[578]</sup></a>Tiryns; the walls of which were
  esteemed no less a wonder than the <a name="footnotetag579"
  href="#footnote579"><sup>[579]</sup></a>pyramids of Egypt. They must have
  resided at Nauplia in Argolis; a place in situation not unlike Hermione
  above-mentioned. Near this city were caverns in the earth, and
  subterraneous passages, consisting of <a name="footnotetag580"
  href="#footnote580"><sup>[580]</sup></a>labyrinths cut in the rock, like
  the syringes in Upper Egypt, and the maze at the lake Mæris: and these
  too were reputed the work of Cyclopians. Pausanias thinks very truly,
  that the Nauplians were from Egypt. <a name="footnotetag581"

  <i>The Nauplians seem to me to have been a colony from Egypt in the more
  early times</i>. He supposes that they were some of those emigrants, who
  came over with Danaüs. The nature of the works, which the Cyclopians
  executed, and the lake, which they named Acherusia, shew plainly the part
  of the world from whence they came. The next city to Nauplia was
  Tr&#339;zen, where Orus was said to have once reigned, from whom the
  country was called Oraia: but Pausanias very justly thinks, that it was
  an Egyptian history; and that the region was denominated from <a
  name="footnotetag582" href="#footnote582"><sup>[582]</sup></a>Orus of
  Egypt, whose worship undoubtedly had been here introduced. So that every
  circumstance witnesses the country, from whence the Cyclopians came.

  to have been the first who made use of Tiryns as an harbour; which place
  he walled round by the assistance of the Cyclopians. They were seven in
  number, styled Gastrocheirs; and lived by their labour.</i> Hesychius in
  some degree reverses this strange name, and says, that they were called
  <span title="Encheirogasteres" class="grk"

  The Grecians continually mistook places for persons, as I have shewn.
  These seven Cyclopes were, I make no doubt, seven Cyclopian towers built
  by the people, of whom I have been treating. Some of them stood towards
  the harbour to afford light to ships, when they approached in the night.
  They were sacred to Aster, or <a name="footnotetag585"
  href="#footnote585"><sup>[585]</sup></a>Astarte; and styled Astro-caer,
  and Caer-Aster; out of which the Greeks formed <span title="Gastrocheir" class="grk"

  a strange medley made up of hands, and bellies. Strabo in particular
  having converted these building's into so many masons, adds, <a
  name="footnotetag586" href="#footnote586"><sup>[586]</sup></a><span

  &#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>. <i>They were honest
  bellyhanded men, industrious people, who got their livelihood by their
  art</i>. These towers were erected likewise for Purait, or Puratheia,
  where the rites of fire were performed: but Purait, or Puraitus, the
  Greeks changed to <span title="Proitos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>; and gave out
  that the towers were built for <a name="footnotetag587"
  href="#footnote587"><sup>[587]</sup></a>Pr&#339;tus, whom they made a
  king of that country.</p>

  <p>I imagine, that not only the common idea of the Cyclopians was taken
  from towers and edifices; but that the term <span title="Kuklôps" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C8;</span>, and <span
  title="Kuklôpis" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Cuclops, and Cuclopis, signified a building or temple; and from thence
  the people had their name. They were of the same family as the Cadmians,
  and Ph&#339;nices; and as the Hivites, or Ophites who came from Egypt,
  and settled near Libanus and Baal Hermon, upon the confines of Canaan.
  They worshipped the Sun under the symbol of a serpent: hence they were
  styled in different parts, where they in time settled, Europians,
  Oropians, Anopians, Inopians, Asopians, Elopians; all which names relate
  to the worship of the Pytho Ops, or Opis. What may be the precise
  etymology of the term <span title="Kuklôps" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BB;&#x3C9;&#x3C8;</span>, Cuclops, I cannot
  presume to determine. Cuclops, as a personage, was said to have been the
  son of <a name="footnotetag588"
  href="#footnote588"><sup>[588]</sup></a>Ouranus and the earth: which
  Ouranus among the Amonians was often styled C&#339;l, or C&#339;lus; and
  was worshipped under the forementioned emblem of a serpent. Hence the
  temple of the Deity may have been originally called Cu-C&#339;l-Ops,
  Domus C&#339;li Pythonis; and the priests and people Cucelopians. But
  whatever may have been the purport of the name, the history of these
  personages is sufficiently determinate.</p>

  <p>There was a place in Thrace called <a name="footnotetag589"
  href="#footnote589"><sup>[589]</sup></a>Cuclops, where some of the
  Cyclopian race had settled; for many of the Amonians came hither. Hence
  Thrace seems at one time to have been the seat of science: and the
  Athenians acknowledged, that they borrowed largely from them. The natives
  were very famous; particularly the Pierians for their music, the Peonians
  for pharmacy, and the Edonians for their rites and worship. Those, who
  went under the name of Cyclopes, probably introduced architecture; for
  which art they seem to have been every where noted. There was a fountain
  in these parts, of which Aristotle takes notice, as of a wonderful
  nature. <a name="footnotetag590"

  <i>Theopompus mentions a fountain among the Charopes of Thrace, in which,
  if a person attempts to bathe, he immediately loses his life.</i> I have
  taken notice of this history, because we find, that the persons who are
  called <a name="footnotetag592"
  href="#footnote592"><sup>[592]</sup></a>Cuclopes by one writer, are
  styled Char-opes by another, and very justly: for the terms are nearly of
  the same purport. The Charopes were denominated from a temple, and place
  called Char-Ops, or Char-Opis, locus Dei Pythonis: and the Cyclopes were,
  as I have before supposed, denominated from Cu-Coel-Ops, or Cu-Coel-Opis,
  the temple of the same Deity. They were both equally named from the
  Ophite God, the great object of their adoration, and from the temple
  where he was worshipped.</p>

  <p>The head of Medusa in Argolis is said to have been the work of the <a
  name="footnotetag593" href="#footnote593"><sup>[593]</sup></a>Cyclopians.
  This seems to have been an antient hieroglyphical representation upon the
  temple of Caphisus. It was usual with the Egyptians, and other Amonians,
  to describe, upon the Architrave of their temples, some emblem of the
  Deity, who there presided. This representation was often an eagle, or
  vulture; a wolf, or a lion; also an heart, or an eye. The last, as I have
  shewn, was common to the temples of <a name="footnotetag594"
  href="#footnote594"><sup>[594]</sup></a>Osiris, and was intended to
  signify the superintendency of Providence, from whom nothing was hid.
  Among others the serpent was esteemed a most salutary emblem: and they
  made use of it to signify superior skill and knowledge. A beautiful
  female countenance, surrounded with an assemblage of serpents, was made
  to denote divine wisdom, which they styled Meed, and Meet, the <span
  title="Mêtis" class="grk">&#x39C;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span> of
  the Greeks. Under this characteristic they represented an heavenly
  personage, and joined her with Eros, or divine love: and by these two
  they supposed that the present mundane system was produced. Orpheus
  speaks of this Deity in the masculine gender:</p>

  <p>On this account many antient temples were ornamented with this curious
  hieroglyphic: and among others the temple of Caphisus <a
  name="footnotetag596" href="#footnote596"><sup>[596]</sup></a>in Argolis.
  Caphisus is a compound of Caph-Isis, which signifies Petra Isidis, and
  relates to the same Deity as Metis. For we must not regard sexes, nor
  difference of appellations, when we treat of antient Deities.</p>

  <p>I have taken notice that the Cyclopians of Thrace were styled
  Charopes; which name they must have received from their rites, and place
  of worship. Char-Opis signifies the temple of the Python, or serpent: and
  we find that it was situated near a poisonous pool. It was sacred to the
  Sun: and there were many temples of this name in <a name="footnotetag599"
  href="#footnote599"><sup>[599]</sup></a>Egypt, and other countries. The
  Sun was called Arez; and the lion, which was an emblem of the Sun, had
  the same denomination: and there is reason to think, that the device upon
  Charopian temples was sometimes a lion. Homer, undoubtedly, had seen the
  fierce figure of this animal upon some sacred portal in Egypt; to which
  he often alludes, when he speaks of a Charopian lion.</p>

  <p>The devices upon temples were often esteemed as talismans, and
  supposed to have an hidden and salutary influence, by which the building
  was preserved. In the temple of Minerva, at Tegea, was some sculpture of
  Medusa, which the Goddess was said to have given, <a

  <p>The Poets considered them merely in the capacity of blacksmiths, and
  condemned them to the anvil. This arose from the chief Cyclopian Deity
  being called Acmon, and Pyracmon. He was worshipped under the former
  title in Phrygia; where was a city and district called Acmonia, mentioned
  by Alexander <a name="footnotetag604"
  href="#footnote604"><sup>[604]</sup></a>Polyhistor. The Amazonians paid
  the like reverence: and there was a sacred grove called Acmonium upon the

  great repute. He was by some looked upon as the offspring of heaven; by

  Acmonides was supposed to have been his <a name="footnotetag606"

  <p>The term has commonly been looked upon as an adjective; and the

  the Cyclopian God Acmon, whom he makes the <span title="theos propulaios" class="grk"

  called Hercules, and particularly styled Tirynthius, to whom Callimachus
  here alludes, under a more antient name.</p>

  <p>As the Cyclopians were great artists, they probably were famous for
  works in brass, and iron: and that circumstance in their history may have
  been founded in truth. The Idæi Dactyli were Cyclopians: and they are
  said to have first forged metals, and to have reduced them to common <a
  name="footnotetag609" href="#footnote609"><sup>[609]</sup></a>use; the
  knowledge of which art they obtained from the fusion of minerals at the
  burning of mount <a name="footnotetag610"
  href="#footnote610"><sup>[610]</sup></a>Ida. Whether this was an eruption
  of fire from the internal part of the mountain, or only a fire kindled
  among the forests, which crowned its summit, cannot be determined. It was
  an event of antient date; and admitted, as a remarkable epocha, in the
  most early series of chronology. From this event the Curetes, and
  Corybantes, who were the same as the <a name="footnotetag611"
  href="#footnote611"><sup>[611]</sup></a>Idæi Dactyli, are supposed to
  have learned the mystery of fusing and forging metals. From them it was
  propagated to many countries westward, particularly to the Pangæan
  mountains, and the region Curetis, where the Cyclopians dwelt in Thrace:
  also to the region Trinacia and Leontina, near Ætna, which they occupied
  in Sicily.</p>

  <p>Thus have I endeavoured to shew the true history <a
  name="footnotetag612" href="#footnote612"><sup>[612]</sup></a>and
  antiquity of this people: and we may learn from their works, <a
  name="footnotetag613" href="#footnote613"><sup>[613]</sup></a>that there
  was a time, when they were held in high estimation. They were denominated
  from their worship: and their chief Deity among other titles was styled
  Acmon, and Pyracmon. They seem to have been great in many sciences: but
  the term Acmon signifying among the Greeks an anvil, the Poets have
  limited them to one base department, and considered them as so many
  blacksmiths. And as they resided near Ætna, they have made the burning
  mountain their forge:</p>

<h4>OF</h4>

<h2>TEMPLE RITES</h2>

<h4>IN THE</h4>

<h3>FIRST AGES.</h3>

  <p>I must continually put the reader in mind how common it was among the
  Greeks, not only out of the titles of the Deities, but out of the names
  of towers, and other edifices, to form personages, and then to invent
  histories to support what they had done. When they had created a number
  of such ideal beings, they tried to find out some relation: and thence
  proceeded to determine the parentage, and filiation of each, just as
  fancy directed. Some colonies from Egypt, and Canaan, settled in Thrace;
  as appears from numberless memorials. The parts which they occupied were
  upon the Hebrus, about Edonia, Sithonia, and Mount Hæmus. They also held
  Pieria, and Peonia, and all the sea coast region. It was their custom, as
  I have before mentioned, in all their settlements to form puratheia; and
  to introduce the rites of fire, and worship of the Sun. Upon the coast,
  of which I have been speaking, a temple of this sort was founded, which
  is called Torone. The name is a compound of Tor-On, as I have before
  taken notice. The words purathus, and puratheia, were, in the language of
  Egypt, Pur-Ath, and Por-Ait, formed from two titles of the God of fire.
  Out of one of these the Grecians made a personage, which they expressed
  <span title="Proitos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Pr&#339;tus,
  whose daughters, or rather priestesses, were the Pr&#339;tides. And as
  they followed the Egyptian rites, and held a Cow sacred, they were, in
  consequence of it, supposed to have been turned into <a
  name="footnotetag615" href="#footnote615"><sup>[615]</sup></a>cows; just
  as the priestesses of Hippa were said to have been changed into mares;
  the &#338;notropæ and Peleiadæ into pigeons. Proteus of Egypt, whom
  Menelaus was supposed to have consulted about his passage homeward, was a
  tower of this sort with a purait. It was an edifice, where both priests
  and pilots resided to give information; and where a light was continually
  burning to direct the ships in the night. The tower of Torone likewise
  was a Pharos, and therefore styled by Lycophron <span title="phlegraia Torônê" class="grk"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;
  &#x3A4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, the flaming Torone.
  The country about it was, in like manner, called <a name="footnotetag616"
  href="#footnote616"><sup>[616]</sup></a><span title="Phlegra" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, Phlegra, both from
  these flaming Towers, and from the worship there introduced. There seems
  to have been a fire-tower in this region named Proteus; for, according to
  the antient accounts, Proteus is mentioned as having resided in these
  parts, and is said to have been married to Torone. He is accordingly
  styled by the Poet,</p>

  sad, implies a bad character, which arose from the cruel rites practised
  in these places. In all these temples they made it a rule to sacrifice
  strangers, whom fortune brought in their way. Torone stood near <a

  earth-born, or giant brood</i>. Under this character both the sons of
  Chus, and the Anakim of Canaan are included. Lycophron takes off from
  Proteus the imputation of being accessary to the vile practices, for
  which the place was notorious; and makes only his sons guilty of
  murdering strangers. He says, that their father left them out of
  disgust,</p>

  <p>In this he alludes to a custom, of which I shall take notice
  hereafter. According to Eustathius, the notion was, that Proteus fled by
  a subterraneous passage to Egypt, in company with his daughter Eidothea.

  &#x395;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;.</span> He went,
  it seems, from one Pharos to another; from Pallene to the mouth of the
  Nile. The Pharos of Egypt was both a watch-tower, and a temple, where
  people went to inquire about the success of their voyage; and to obtain
  the assistance of pilots. Proteus was an Egyptian title of the Deity,
  under which he was worshipped, both in the Pharos, and at <a
  name="footnotetag622" href="#footnote622"><sup>[622]</sup></a>Memphis. He
  was the same as Osiris, and Canobus: and particularly the God of
  mariners, who confined his department to the <a name="footnotetag623"
  href="#footnote623"><sup>[623]</sup></a>sea. From hence, I think, we may
  unravel the mystery about the pilot of Menelaus, who is said to have been
  named Canobus, and to have given name to the principal seaport in Egypt.
  The priests of the country laughed at the idle <a name="footnotetag624"
  href="#footnote624"><sup>[624]</sup></a>story; and they had good reason:
  for the place was far prior to the people spoken of, and the name not of
  Grecian original. It is observable, that Stephanus of Byzantium gives the
  pilot another name, calling him, instead of Canobus, <span title="Pharos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, Pharus. His words are <span
  title="Pharos ho Prôreus Menalaou" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x1F41;
  &#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>, which
  are scarce sense. I make no doubt, from the history of Proteus above, but
  that in the original, whence Stephanus copied, or at least whence the
  story was first taken, the reading was <span title="Pharos ho Prôteus Menelaou" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; &#x1F41;
  &#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;
  &#x39C;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>; that is,
  the Proteus of Menelaus, so celebrated by Homer, who is represented, as
  so wise, and so experienced in navigation, whom they esteemed a great
  prophet, and a Deity of the sea, was nothing else but a Pharos. In other
  words, it was a temple of Proteus upon the Canobic branch of the Nile, to
  which the Poet makes Menelaus have recourse. Such was the original
  history: but <span title="Prôteus Menelaou" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;

  changed to <span title="prôreus" class="grk"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>; and the God
  Canobus turned into a Grecian pilot. As these were Ophite temples, a
  story has been added about this person having been stung by a serpent. <a

  &#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3B7;.</span> <i>This Pilot was bitten by a
  serpent, and buried in the island</i>. Conformable to my opinion is the
  account given by Tzetzes, who says, that Proteus resided in the <a
  name="footnotetag626" href="#footnote626"><sup>[626]</sup></a>Pharos: by
  which is signified, that he was the Deity of the place. He is represented
  in the Orphic poetry as the first-born of the world, the chief God of the
  sea, and at the same time a mighty <a name="footnotetag627"
  href="#footnote627"><sup>[627]</sup></a>prophet.</p>

  <p>The history then of Menelaus in Egypt, if such a person ever existed,
  amounts to this. In a state of uncertainty he applied to a temple near
  Canobus, which was sacred to Proteus. This was one title out of many, by
  which the chief Deity of the country was worshipped, and was equivalent
  to On, Orus, Osiris, and Canobus. From this place Menelaus obtained
  proper advice, by which he directed his voyage. Hence some say, that he
  had <span title="Phrontis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, Phrontis, for
  his pilot. <a name="footnotetag628"
  href="#footnote628"><sup>[628]</sup></a><span title="Kubernêtês aristos Menelaou ho Phrontis, huios Onêtoros." class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3B2;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;

  &#x3A6;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,
  &#x1F51;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x39F;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;.</span>
  <i>Menelaus had an excellent pilot, one Phrontis, the son of Onetor.</i>
  This, I think, confirms all that I have been saying: for what is
  Phrontis, but advice and experience? and what is Onetor, but the Pharos,
  from whence it was obtained? Onetor is the same as Torone, <span
  title="Torônê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, only reversed. They
  were both temples of Proteus, the same as On, and Orus: both <span
  title="Phlegraiai" class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,
  by which is meant temples of fire, or light-houses. Hence we may be
  pretty certain, that the three pilots, Canobus, Phrontis, Pharos,
  together with Onetor, were only poetical personages: and that the terms
  properly related to towers, and sanctuaries, which were of Egyptian
  original.</p>

  <p>These places were courts of justice, where the priests seem to have
  practised a strict inquisition; and where pains and penalties were very
  severe. The notion of the Furies was taken from these temples: for the
  term Furia is from Ph'ur, ignis, and signifies a priest of fire. It was
  on account of the cruelties here practised, that most of the antient
  judges are represented as inexorable; and are therefore made judges in
  hell. Of what nature their department was esteemed may be learned from
  Virgil,</p>

  <p>The temple at Phlegya in B&#339;otia was probably one of these courts;
  where justice was partially administered, and where great cruelties were
  exercised by the priests. Hence a person, named Phlegyas, is represented
  in the shades below, crying out in continual agony, and exhorting people
  to justice.</p>

  <p>Excellent counsel, but introduced rather too late. Phlegyas was in
  reality the Sun; so denominated by the Æthiopes, or Cuthites, and
  esteemed the same as Mithras of Persis. They looked up to him as their
  great benefactor, and lawgiver: for they held their laws as of divine
  original. His worship was introduced among the natives of Greece by the
  Cuthites, styled Ethiopians, who came from Egypt. That this was the true
  history of Phlegyas we may be assured from Stephanus, and Phavorinus.
  They mention both Phlegyas, and Mithras, as men deified; and specify,
  that they were of Ethiopian original. <a name="footnotetag631"

  an upright judge: and the person alluded to under that character was
  eminently distinguished for his piety, and justice. But his priests were
  esteemed far otherwise, for they were guilty of great cruelties. Hence we
  find, that Minos was looked upon as a judge of hell, and styled Quæsitor
  Minos. He was in reality a Deity, the same as Menes, and Menon of Egypt:
  and as Manes of Lydia, Persis, and other countries. And though his
  history be not consistently exhibited, yet, so much light may be gained
  from the Cretans, as to certify us, that there was in their island a
  temple called Men-Tor, the tower of Men, or Menes. The Deity, from a
  particular <a name="footnotetag632"
  href="#footnote632"><sup>[632]</sup></a>hieroglyphic, under which the
  natives worshipped him, was styled Minotaurus. To this temple the
  Athenians were obliged annually to send some of their prime youth to be
  sacrificed; just as the people of Carthage used to send their children to
  be victims at <a name="footnotetag633"
  href="#footnote633"><sup>[633]</sup></a>Tyre. The Athenians were obliged
  for some time to pay this tribute, as appears from the festival in
  commemoration of their deliverance. The places most infamous for these
  customs were those, which were situated upon the seacoast: and especially
  those dangerous passes, where sailors were obliged to go on shore for
  assistance, to be directed in their way. Scylla upon the coast of Rhegium
  was one of these: and appears to have been particularly dreaded by
  mariners. Ulysses in Homer says, that he was afraid to mention her name
  to his companions, lest they should through astonishment have lost all
  sense of preservation.</p>

  <p>Some suppose Scylla to have been a dangerous rock; and that it was
  abominated on account of the frequent shipwrecks. There was a rock of
  that name, but attended with no such peril. We are informed by Seneca, <a
  name="footnotetag635" href="#footnote635"><sup>[635]</sup></a>Scyllam
  saxum esse, et quidem non terribile navigantibus. It was the temple,
  built of old upon that <a name="footnotetag636"
  href="#footnote636"><sup>[636]</sup></a>eminence, and the customs which
  prevailed within, that made it so detested. This temple was a Petra:
  hence Scylla is by Homer styled <span title="Skullê Petraiê" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;
  &#x3A0;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B7;</span>; and the dogs,
  with which she was supposed to have been surrounded, were Cahen, or
  priests.</p>

  <p>As there was a Men-tor in Crete, so there was a place of the same
  name, only reversed, in Sicily, called Tor-men, and Tauromenium. There is
  reason to think, that the same cruel practices prevailed here. It stood
  in the country of the Lamiæ, Lestrygons, and Cyclopes, upon the river
  On-Baal, which the Greeks rendered Onoballus. From hence we may conclude,
  that it was one of the Cyclopian buildings. Homer has presented us with
  something of truth, though we receive it sadly mixed with fable. We find
  from him, that when Ulysses entered the dangerous pass of Rhegium, he had
  six of his comrades seized by Scylla: and he loses the same number in the
  cavern of the Cyclops, which that monster devoured. Silenus, in a passage
  before taken notice of, is by Euripides made to say, that the most
  agreeable repast to the Cyclops was the flesh of strangers: nobody came
  within his reach, that he did not feed upon.</p>

  <p>From these accounts some have been led to think, that the priests in
  these temples really fed upon the flesh of the persons sacrificed: and
  that these stories at bottom allude to a shocking depravity; such, as one
  would hope, that human nature could not be brought to. Nothing can be
  more horrid, than the cruel process of the Cyclops, as it is represented
  by Homer. And though it be veiled under the shades of poetry, we may
  still learn the detestation, in which these places were held.</p>

  <p>One would not be very forward to strengthen an imputation, which
  disgraces human nature: yet there must certainly have been something
  highly brutal and depraved in the character of this people, to have given
  rise to this description of foul and unnatural feeding. What must not be
  concealed, Euhemerus, an antient writer, who was a native of these parts,
  did aver, that this bestial practice once prevailed. Saturn's devouring
  his own children is supposed to allude to this custom. And we learn from
  this writer, as the passage has been transmitted by <a
  name="footnotetag640" href="#footnote640"><sup>[640]</sup></a>Ennius,
  that not only Saturn, but Ops, and the rest of mankind in their days,
  used to feed upon human flesh.&mdash;<a name="footnotetag641"
  href="#footnote641"><sup>[641]</sup></a>Saturnum, et Opem, cæterosque tum
  homines humanam carnem solitos esitare. He speaks of Saturn, and Ops, as
  of persons, who once lived in the world, and were thus guilty. But the
  priests of their temples were the people to be really accused; the
  Cyclopians, Lamiæ, and Lestrygons, who officiated at their altars. He
  speaks of the custom, as well known: and it had undoubtedly been
  practised in those parts, where in aftertimes hie was born. For he was a
  native <a name="footnotetag642"
  href="#footnote642"><sup>[642]</sup></a>of Zancle, and lived in the very
  country, of which we have been speaking, in the land of the Lestrygons,
  and Cyclopians. The promontory of Scylla was within his sight. He was
  therefore well qualified to give an account of these parts; and his
  evidence must necessarily have weight. Without doubt these cruel
  practices left lasting impressions; and the memorials were not effaced
  for ages.</p>

  <p>It is said of Orpheus by Horace, Cædibus, et victu f&#339;do
  deterruit: by which one should be led to think, that the putting a stop
  to this unnatural gratification was owing to him. Others think, that he
  only discountenanced the eating of raw flesh, which before had been
  usual. But this could not be true of Orpheus: for it was a circumstance,
  which made one part of his institutes. If there were ever such a man, as
  Orpheus, he enjoined the very thing, which he is supposed to have
  prohibited. For both in the <a name="footnotetag643"
  href="#footnote643"><sup>[643]</sup></a>orgies of Bacchus and in the
  rites of Ceres, as well as of other Deities, one part of the mysteries
  consisted in a ceremony styled <span title="ômophagia" class="grk"
  >&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>; at
  which time they eat the flesh quite crude with the blood. In Crete at the
  <a name="footnotetag644"
  href="#footnote644"><sup>[644]</sup></a>Dionusiaca they used to tear the
  flesh with their teeth from the animal, when alive. This they did in
  commemoration of Dionusus. <a name="footnotetag645"
  href="#footnote645"><sup>[645]</sup></a>Festos funeris dies statuunt, et
  annuum sacrum trietericâ consecratione componunt, omnia per ordinem
  facientes, quæ puer moriens aut fecit, aut passus est. <i>Vivum laniant
  dentibus Taurum</i>, crudeles epulas annuis commemorationibus excitantes.

  In the island of Chios it was a religious custom to tear a man limb from

  From all which we may learn one sad truth, that there is scarce any thing
  so impious and unnatural, as not at times to have prevailed.</p>

  <p>We need not then wonder at the character given of the Lestiygones,
  Lamiæ, and Cyclopians, who were inhabitants of Sicily, and lived nearly
  in the same part of the island. They seem to have been the priests, and
  priestesses, of the Leontini, who resided at Pelorus, and in the
  Cyclopian towers: on which account the Lamiæ are by Lucilius termed <a
  name="footnotetag649" href="#footnote649"><sup>[649]</sup></a>Turricolæ.
  They are supposed to have delighted in human blood, like the Cyclopians,
  but with this difference, that their chief repast was the flesh of young
  persons and children; of which they are represented as very greedy. They
  were priests of Ham, called El Ham; from whence was formed &#x2019;Lamus
  and &#x2019;Lamia. Their chief city, the same probably, which was named
  Tauromenium, is mentioned by Homer, as the city of Lamus.</p>

  That they were Amonians, and came originally from Babylonia, is pretty

  the daughter of Poseidon. <a name="footnotetag655"

  Under the character of one person is to be understood a priesthood: of
  which community each man was called Lamus, and each priestess Lamia. By
  the Sibyl being the daughter of Lamia, the daughter of Poseidon, is
  meant, that she was of Lamian original, and ultimately descended from the
  great Deity of the sea. Who is alluded to under that character, will
  hereafter be shewn. The countries, to which the Sibyl is referred, point
  out her extraction: for she is said to have come from Egypt, and
  Babylonia. <a name="footnotetag656"

  If the Sibyl came from Babylonia and Egypt, her supposed parent, Lamia,
  must have been of the same original.</p>

  <p>The Lamiæ were not only to be found in Italy, and Sicily, but Greece,
  Pontus, and <a name="footnotetag657"
  href="#footnote657"><sup>[657]</sup></a>Libya. And however widely they
  may have been separated, they are still represented in the same
  unfavourable light. Euripides says, that their very name was

  These descriptions are perhaps carried to a great excess; yet the history

  left upon the minds of men from the barbarity of the first ages.</p>

  <p>One of the principal places in Italy, where the Lamia seated
  themselves, was about Formiæ; of which Horace takes notice in his Ode to
  Ælius Lamia.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag661" href="#footnote661"><sup>[661]</sup></a>Æli, vetusto nobilis ab Lamo, &amp;c.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The chief temple of the Formians was upon the sea-coast at Caiete. It
  is said to have had its name from a woman, who died here: and whom some
  make the nurse of Æneas, others of Ascanius, others still of <a
  name="footnotetag662" href="#footnote662"><sup>[662]</sup></a>Creusa. The
  truth is this: it stood near a cavern, sacred to the God Ait, called Ate,
  Atis, and Attis; and it was hence called Caieta, and Caiatta. Strabo
  says, that it was denominated from a cave, though he did not know the
  precise <a name="footnotetag663"
  href="#footnote663"><sup>[663]</sup></a>etymology. There were also in the
  rock some wonderful subterranes, which branched out into various
  apartments. Here the antient Lamii, the priests of Ham, <a
  name="footnotetag664" href="#footnote664"><sup>[664]</sup></a>resided:
  whence Silius Italicus, when he speaks of the place, styles it <a
  name="footnotetag665" href="#footnote665"><sup>[665]</sup></a>Regnata
  Lamo Caieta. They undoubtedly sacrificed children here; and probably the
  same custom was common among the Lamii, as prevailed among the
  Lacedæmonians, who used to whip their children round the altar of Diana
  Orthia. Thus much we are assured by Fulgentius, and others, that the
  usual term among the antient Latines for the whipping of children was
  Caiatio. <a name="footnotetag666"
  href="#footnote666"><sup>[666]</sup></a>Apud Antiquos Caiatio dicebatur
  puerilis cædes.</p>

  <p>The coast of Campania seems to have been equally infamous: and as much
  dreaded by mariners, as that of Rhegium, and Sicily. Here the Sirens
  inhabited, who are represented, as the bane of all, who navigated those
  seas. They like the Lamii were Cuthite, and Canaanitish priests, who had
  founded temples in these parts; and particularly near three small
  islands, to which they gave name. These temples were rendered more than
  ordinary famous on account of the women, who officiated. They were much
  addicted to the cruel rites, of which I have been speaking; so that the
  shores, upon which they resided, are described, as covered with the bones
  of men, destroyed by their artifice.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag667" href="#footnote667"><sup>[667]</sup></a>Jamque adeo scopulos Sirenum advecta subibat,</p>
      <p>Difficiles quondam, multorumque ossibus albos.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>They used hymns in their temples, accompanied with the music of their
  country: which must have been very enchanting, as we may judge from the
  traditions handed down of its efficacy. I have mentioned, that the songs
  of the Canaanites and Cretans were particularly plaintive, and
  pleasing:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><a name="footnotetag668" href="#footnote668"><sup>[668]</sup></a>They sang in sweet but melancholy strains;</p>
      <p>Such as were warbled by the Delian God,</p>
      <p>When in the groves of Ida he bewail'd</p>
      <p>The lovely lost Atymnius.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But nothing can shew more fully the power of antient harmony than the
  character given of the Sirens. Their cruelty the antients held in
  detestation; yet always speak feelingly of their music. They represent
  their songs as so fatally winning, that nobody could withstand their
  sweetness. All were soothed with it; though their life was the purchase
  of the gratification. The Scholiast upon Lycophron makes them the
  children of the muse <a name="footnotetag669"
  href="#footnote669"><sup>[669]</sup></a>Terpsichore. Nicander supposes
  their mother to have been Melpomene: others make her Calliope. The whole
  of this is merely an allegory; and means only that they were the
  daughters of harmony. Their efficacy is mentioned by <a
  name="footnotetag670" href="#footnote670"><sup>[670]</sup></a>Apollonius
  Rhodius: and by the Author of the Orphic <a name="footnotetag671"
  href="#footnote671"><sup>[671]</sup></a>Argonautica: but the account
  given by Homer is by far the most affecting.</p>

  <p>The story at bottom relates to the people above-mentioned; who with
  their music used to entice strangers into the purlieus of their temples,
  and then put them to death. Nor was it music only, with which persons
  were seduced to follow them. The female part of their choirs were
  maintained for a twofold purpose, both on account of their voices and
  their beauty. They were accordingly very liberal of their favours, and by
  these means enticed seafaring persons, who paid dearly for their
  entertainment. Scylla was a personage of this sort: and among the
  fragments of Callimachus we have a short, but a most perfect, description
  of her character.</p>

  <i>Scylla was originally a handsome wench: but being too free with
  seafaring people she made herself a beast</i>. She was, like the Sibyl of
  Campania, said by Stesichorus to have been the daughter of <a
  name="footnotetag675" href="#footnote675"><sup>[675]</sup></a>Lamia.
  Hence we may learn, that all, who resided in the places, which I have
  been describing, were of the same religion, and of the same family; being
  the descendants of Ham, and chiefly by the collateral branches of Chus,
  and Canaan.</p>

  <p>The like rites prevailed in Cyprus, which had in great measure been
  peopled by persons of these <a name="footnotetag676"
  href="#footnote676"><sup>[676]</sup></a>families. One of their principal
  cities was Curium, which was denominated from <a name="footnotetag677"
  href="#footnote677"><sup>[677]</sup></a>Curos, the Sun, the Deity, to
  whom it was sacred. In the perilous voyages of the antients nothing was
  more common than for strangers, whether shipwrecked, or otherwise
  distressed, to fly to the altar of the chief Deity, <span title="Theou philiou, kai xeniou" class="grk"
  >&#x398;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3C5; &#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3BE;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>,
  <i>the God of charity and hospitality</i>, for his protection. This was
  fatal to those who were driven upon the western coast of Cyprus. The
  natives of Curium made it a rule to destroy all such, under an appearance
  of a religious rite. Whoever laid their hands upon the altar of Apollo,
  were cast down the precipice, upon which it stood. <a

  <p>The den of Cacus was properly Ca-Chus, the cavern or temple of Chus,
  out of which the poets, and later historians have formed a strange
  personage, whom they represent as a shepherd, and the son of Vulcan. Many
  antient Divinities, whose rites and history had any relation to Ur in
  Chaldea, are said to have been the children of Vulcan; and oftentimes to
  have been born in fire. There certainly stood a temple of old upon the
  Aventine mountain in Latium, which was the terror of the neighbourhood.
  The cruelties of the priests, and their continual depredations, may be
  inferred from the history of Cacus. Virgil makes Evander describe the
  place to Æneas; though it is supposed in his time to have been in
  ruins.</p>

  <p>What we express Cocytus, and suppose to have been merely a river, was
  originally a temple in Egypt called Co-Cutus: for rivers were generally
  denominated from some town, or temple, near which they ran. Co-Cutus
  means the Cuthite temple, the house of Cuth. It was certainly a place of
  inquisition, where great cruelties were exercised. Hence the river, which
  was denominated from it, was esteemed a river of hell; and was supposed
  to have continual cries, and lamentations resounding upon its waters.</p>

  <p>One of the most antient Deities of the Amonians was named Meed, or

  Grecians <span title="Mêtis" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span> in the masculine: but seems
  to have been a feminine Deity; and represented under the symbol of a
  beautiful female countenance surrounded with serpents. The author of the
  Orphic Poetry makes Metis the origin of all <a name="footnotetag687"

  proceeded. By Timotheus Chronographus, in his account of the creation,
  this divinity was described as that vivifying light, which first broke

  another Goddess, of the like antiquity, and equally obsolete. Some traces
  however are to be still found in the Orphic verses above-mentioned, by
  which we may discover her original character and department. She is there
  represented as the nurse of <a name="footnotetag690"
  href="#footnote690"><sup>[690]</sup></a>Dionusus, and seems to have been
  the same as Cybele, who was worshipped in the mountains of <a
  name="footnotetag691" href="#footnote691"><sup>[691]</sup></a>Phrygia,
  and by the Lydians upon Tmolus. She is said to have been the soul of the
  <a name="footnotetag692" href="#footnote692"><sup>[692]</sup></a>world:
  and the person who received and fostered Dionusus, when he came from the
  thigh of his father. This history relates to his second birth, when he
  returned to a second state of childhood. Dionusus was the chief God of
  the Gentile world, and worshipped under various titles; which at length
  came to be looked upon as different Deities. Most of these secondary
  Divinities had the title of Hippius, and Hippia: and as they had female
  attendants in their temples, these too had the name of Hippai. What may
  have been the original of the term Hippa, and Hippus, will be matter of
  future disquisition. Thus much is certain, that the Greeks, who were but
  little acquainted with the purport of their antient theology, uniformly
  referred it to <a name="footnotetag693"
  href="#footnote693"><sup>[693]</sup></a>horses. Hence it was often
  prefixed to the names of Gods, and of Goddesses, when it had no relation
  to their department; and seemed inconsistent with their character. We
  have not only an account of <span title="Arês Hippios" class="grk"

  but of Poseidon Hippius, though a God of the sea. He is accordingly
  complimented upon this title by the Poet Aristophanes.</p>

  titles given to Juno at Olympia. For they sacrificed here to <a

  Juno, and to Juno Paramonian; which were also titles of Hermes. Hippa was

  <p>These Hippai, misconstrued mares, were priestesses of the Goddess
  Hippa, who was of old worshipped in Thessaly, and Thrace, and in many
  different regions. They chanted hymns in her temples, and performed the
  rites of fire: but the worship growing obsolete, the very terms were at
  last mistaken. How far this worship once prevailed may be known from the
  many places denominated from Hippa. It was a title of Apollo, or the Sun,
  and often compounded Hippa On, and contracted Hippon: of which name
  places occur in Africa near Carthage<a name="footnotetag704"

  was a title of the Sun, it was sometimes expressed in the masculine
  gender Hippos: and Pausanias takes notice of a most curious, and
  remarkable piece of antiquity, though he almost ruins the purport of it
  by referring it to an horse. It stood near mount Taygetus in Laconia, and
  was called the monument of Hippos. The author tells us, <a

  these exterior stones related to the <a name="footnotetag707"

  sphere, the central monument of Hippos must necessarily have been
  designed for the Sun. And however rude the whole may possibly have
  appeared, it is the most antient representation upon record, and
  consequently the most curious, of the planetary system.</p>

  <p>It is from hence, I think, manifest, that the titles Hippa, and
  Hippos, related to the luminary Osiris; and betokened some particular
  department of that Deity, who was the same as Dionusus. He was
  undoubtedly worshipped under this appellation in various regions: hence

  science: but by the Greeks it was referred to an animal, and supposed to
  have been produced by the hoof of an horse. The rites of Dionusus Hippius

  been fed with human flesh. Deianira is introduced by Ovid, as asking

  which fed upon the flesh of strangers, were the priests of Hippa, and of
  Dionusus, styled Hippus, or more properly Hippius. They seem to have
  resided in an island, and probably in the Thracian Chersonese: which they
  denominated <a name="footnotetag711"
  href="#footnote711"><sup>[711]</sup></a>Diu-Medes, or the island of the
  Egyptian Deity Medes. From hence the Grecian Poets have formed a
  personage Diomedes, whom they have made king of the country. There were
  opposite to Apulia islands of the same name, where similar rites
  prevailed. The priests were here Cycneans, and described as a species of
  swans, who were kind to people of their own race, but cruel to <a
  name="footnotetag712" href="#footnote712"><sup>[712]</sup></a>strangers.
  A Diomedes is supposed to have been a king in these parts, and to have
  given name to these islands. It is said by Scymnus Chios above, that
  Abderus, who was devoured by the horses of Diomedes in Thrace, built the
  city, which bore his name. The Grecians continually supposed the
  personage, in whose honour a city was built, to have been the founder. I
  have mentioned, that Abderus signifies the place of Abdir, which is a
  contraction of Abadir, the serpent Deity Ad-Ur, or Adorus. And it is
  plain from many passages in antient writers, that human sacrifices were
  common at his shrine; and particularly those of infants. By Abdera being
  a victim to the horses of Diomedes is meant that the natives of that
  place, which stood in the vicinity of the Chersonesus, were obliged to
  submit to the cruel rites of the Diomedean <a name="footnotetag713"
  href="#footnote713"><sup>[713]</sup></a>priests. The very name must have
  come from them; for they worshipped the Deity under the titles of Meed,
  Hippa, and Abadir; and various other appellations.</p>

  <p>There is an account given by <a name="footnotetag714"
  href="#footnote714"><sup>[714]</sup></a>Palæphatus of one Metra, who in
  the more authentic manuscripts is called <span title="Mêstra" class="grk"

  of her, that she could change herself into various forms, particularly

  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;,</span>
  <i>that she would instead of a young woman appear an ox, or a cow; or
  else be in the shape of a dog, or of a bird</i>. She is represented as
  the daughter of Eresicthon: and these uncommon properties are mentioned
  by Ovid<a name="footnotetag715" href="#footnote715"><sup>[715]</sup></a>,
  who sets them off with much embellishment. The story at bottom is very
  plain. Egypt, the land of the Mizraim, was by the Greeks often styled <a
  name="footnotetag716" href="#footnote716"><sup>[716]</sup></a>Mestra and
  <a name="footnotetag717"
  href="#footnote717"><sup>[717]</sup></a>Mestraia: and by the person here
  called Mestra we are certainly to understand a woman of that country. She
  was sometimes mentioned simply as a Cahen, or priestess, which the
  Grecians have rendered <span title="kuna" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>, a dog. Women in this sacred
  capacity attended at the shrine of Apis, and Mneuis; and of the sacred
  heifer at Onuphis. Some of them in different countries were styled
  Cygneans, and also Peleiadæ, of whom the principal were the women at <a
  name="footnotetag718" href="#footnote718"><sup>[718]</sup></a>Dodona.
  Many of them were priestesses of Hippa, and upon that account styled
  Hippai, as I have shewn. Hence the mythologists under the character of
  Meestra have represented an Egyptian priestess, who could assume many
  departments, which were misconstrued different shapes. She could become,
  if we may credit Ovid,</p>

  <p>I shall now proceed to the rites of Ceres: and the general character
  of this Goddess is so innocent, and rural, that one would imagine nothing
  cruel could proceed from her shrine. But there was a time, when some of
  her temples were as much dreaded, as those of Scylla, and the Cyclops.
  They were courts of justice; whence she is often spoken of as a
  lawgiver.</p>

  >&#x39A;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, <a name="footnotetag724"
  href="#footnote724"><sup>[724]</sup></a>Cura, a title of the Sun. Her
  Roman name Ceres, expressed by Hesychius Gerys, was by the Dorians more
  properly rendered <a name="footnotetag725"
  href="#footnote725"><sup>[725]</sup></a>Garys. It was originally a name
  of a city, called <span title="Charis" class="grk"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>: for many of the Deities were

  Charis is Char-Is, the <a name="footnotetag726"
  href="#footnote726"><sup>[726]</sup></a>city of fire; the place where
  Orus and Hephastus were worshipped. Hence as a personage she is made the
  wife of <a name="footnotetag727"
  href="#footnote727"><sup>[727]</sup></a>Vulcan, on account of her
  relation to fire. Her title of Damater was equally foreign to Greece; and
  came from Babylonia, and the east. It may after this seem extraordinary,
  that she should ever be esteemed the Goddess of corn. This notion arose
  in part from the Grecians not understanding their own theology: which bad
  originally, became continually more depraved, through their ignorance.
  The towers of Ceres were P'urtain, or <span title="Prutaneia" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>;

  what was a temple of Orus, a granary of corn. In consequence of this,

  was divided into separate and independent hamlets: each of which had its
  own Prutaneion, and Archon. These Archons were priests of the <a

  and were denominated from their office. Archon is the same as Orchon, and

  have mentioned, that these places were temples, and at the same time
  courts of justice: hence we find, that in the Prutaneion at Athens, the
  laws of Solon were <a name="footnotetag737"
  href="#footnote737"><sup>[737]</sup></a>engraved. These laws were
  described upon wooden cylinders: some of which remained to the time of <a
  name="footnotetag738"
  href="#footnote738"><sup>[738]</sup></a>Plutarch.</p>

  <p>Many of these temples were dedicated to the Deity under the name of
  Persephone, or Proserpine, the supposed daughter of Ceres. They were in
  reality the same personage. Persephone was styled <span title="Kora" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, Cora; which the Greeks
  misinterpreted <span title="Parthenos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, the
  virgin, or damsel. How could a person, who according to the received
  accounts had been ravished by Pluto, and been his consort for ages; who
  was the reputed queen of hell, be styled by way of eminence <span
  title="Parthenos" class="grk"

  they understood was the same as Cura, a feminine title of the sun: by
  which Ceres also was called at Cnidos. However mild and gentle Proserpine
  may have been represented in her virgin state by the Poets; yet her
  tribunal seems in many places to have been very formidable. In
  consequence of this we find her with Minos, and Rhadamanthus, condemned
  to the shades below, as an infernal inquisitor. Nonnus says,</p>

  <p><i>Proserpine armed the furies</i>. The notion of which Furies arose
  from the cruelties practised in these Prutaneia. They were called by the
  Latines, Furiæ; and were originally only priests of fire: but were at
  last ranked among the hellish tormentors. Ceres the benefactress, and
  lawgiver, was sometimes enrolled in the list of these dæmons. This is
  manifest from a passage in Antimachus, quoted by Pausanias, where her
  temple is spoken of as the shrine of a Fury.</p>

  <p>I imagine, that the story of the Harpies relates to priests of the
  Sun. They were denominated from their seat of residence, which was an
  oracular temple called Harpi, and Hirpi, analogous to Orphi, and Urphi in
  other places. I have shewn, that the antient name of a priest was Cahen,
  rendered mistakenly <span title="kun" class="grk"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;</span>, and canis. Hence the Harpies, who were
  priests of Ur, are styled by Apollonius, <i>the Dogs of Jove</i>. His
  accosting Calais, and Zethus, tells them, that it would be a profanation
  to offer any injury to those personages.</p>

  <p>This term in the common acceptation is not applicable to the Harpies,
  either as birds, for so they are represented; or as winged animals. But
  this representation was only the insigne of the people, as the vulture,
  and eagle were of the Egyptians: a lion of the Persians. The Harpies were
  certainly a <a name="footnotetag744"
  href="#footnote744"><sup>[744]</sup></a>college of priests in Bithynia;
  and on that account called Cahen. They seem to have been a set of
  rapacious persons, who, for their repeated acts of violence, and cruelty,
  were driven out of the country. Their temple was styled Arpi; and the
  environs Arpi-ai: hence the Grecians formed <a name="footnotetag745"
  href="#footnote745"><sup>[745]</sup></a><span title="Harpuiai." class="grk"
  >&#x1F09;&#x3C1;&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;.</span> There was a
  region in Apulia named Arpi; and in its neighbourhood were the islands of
  Diomedes, and the birds, which were fabled to have been like swans. I
  have before shewn, that they were Amonian priests: so likewise were the
  Hirpi near Soracte in Latium. They were priests of fire: of whose customs
  I have taken notice.</p>

  <p>The persons who resided in these temples are represented as persons of
  great strength and stature: for many of them were of the race of Anac.
  There is reason to think, that a custom prevailed in these places of
  making strangers engage in fight with some of the priests trained up for
  that purpose. The manner of contention was either with the cæstus, or by
  wrestling. And as the priest appointed for the trial was pretty sure of
  coming off the conqueror, the whole was looked upon as a more specious
  kind of sacrifice. Amycus, who was king of Bithynia, is represented as of
  a <a name="footnotetag746"
  href="#footnote746"><sup>[746]</sup></a>gigantic size, and a great
  proficient with the cæstus. He was in consequence of it the terror of all
  strangers who came upon the coast. Cercyon of <a name="footnotetag747"
  href="#footnote747"><sup>[747]</sup></a>Megara was equally famed for
  wrestling; by which art he slew many, whom he forced to the unequal
  contention. But Cercyon was the name of the <a name="footnotetag748"
  href="#footnote748"><sup>[748]</sup></a>place; and they were the
  Cercyonians, the priests of the temple, who were noted for these
  achievements. Pausanias gives an account of them under the character of
  one person. <a name="footnotetag749"

  <i>Cercyon was in other respects lawless in his behaviour towards
  strangers; but especially towards those who would not contend with him in
  wrestling</i>. These Cercyonians were undoubtedly priests of Ceres, or
  Damater: who seems to have been tired of their service, and glad to get
  rid of them, as we are informed by the poet.</p>

  <p>Before most temples of old were areas, which were designed for
  Gumnasia, where these feats of exercise were performed. Lucian speaks of
  one before the temple of <a name="footnotetag751"

  mentions that particular <a name="footnotetag752"
  href="#footnote752"><sup>[752]</sup></a>parade, where Cercyon was
  supposed to have exhibited his art. It stood before the tomb of Alope,
  and was called the Palæstra of Cercyon even in the time of this writer,
  who takes notice of many others. He styles it <span title="taphos Alopês" class="grk"

  &#x391;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>, as if it were a tomb.
  But it was a Taph, or high altar, sacred to Al-Ope, Sol Pytho, who was
  the Deity of the place called Cer-Cuon. Before this altar was the
  palæstra; where the Cercyonian priests obliged people to contend with
  them. I have taken notice of a Pharos at <a name="footnotetag753"

  all strangers whom they forced to engage with them. Taurus, called
  Minotaurus, was a temple in Crete: but by the Grecians is spoken of as a
  person. Under this character Taurus is represented as a <a

  <p>Antient history affords numberless instances of this ungenerous and
  cruel practice. The stranger, who stood most in need of courtesy, was
  treated as a profest enemy: and the rites of hospitality were evaded
  under the undue sanction of a sacrifice to the Gods. In the history of
  Busiris we have an account of this custom prevailing in Egypt. <a

  <p>When the Spaniards got access to the western world, there were to be
  observed many rites, and many terms, similar to those, which were so
  common among the sons of Ham. Among others was this particular custom of
  making the person, who was designed for a victim, engage in fight with a
  priest of the temple. In this manner he was slaughtered: and this
  procedure was esteemed a proper method of <a name="footnotetag769"
  href="#footnote769"><sup>[769]</sup></a>sacrifice.</p>

  <p>The histories of which I have been speaking were founded in truth,
  though the personages are not real. Such customs did prevail in the first
  ages: and in consequence of these customs we find those beggarly
  attributes of wrestling and boxing conferred upon some of the chief
  Divinities. Hercules and Pollux were of that number, who were as
  imaginary beings, as any mentioned above: yet represented upon earth as
  sturdy fellows, who righted some, and <a name="footnotetag770"
  href="#footnote770"><sup>[770]</sup></a>wronged many. They were in short
  a kind of honourable Banditti, who would suffer nobody to do any
  mischief, but themselves. From these customs were derived the Isthmian,
  Nemean, Pythic, and Olympic games, together with those at Delos. Of these
  last Homer gives a fine description in his Hymn to Apollo.</p>

<h2>CAMPE <font class="sc">and</font> CAMPI.</h2>

  <p>Another name for those Amonian temples was Campi, of the same analogy,
  and nearly of the same purport, as Arpi above-mentioned. It was in after
  times made to signify the parade before the temples, where they wrestled,
  and otherwise celebrated their sacred games; and was expressed Campus.
  When chariots came in fashion, these too were admitted within the
  precincts; and races of this sort introduced. Among the Latines the word
  Campus came to mean any open and level space; but among the Sicilians the
  true meaning was in some degree preserved. <span

  was properly a place of exercise in general, and not confined to races.
  Hence a combatant was styled <a name="footnotetag772"

  who presided, <a name="footnotetag773"
  href="#footnote773"><sup>[773]</sup></a>Campigeni. The exercise itself
  was by the Greeks styled <span title="agôn, aethlos, hamilla" class="grk"

  <ins class="correction" title="duplicated over page end in original"
  >taken</ins> from the titles of the Deity, in whose honour the games were
  instituted. These temples partly from their symbols, and partly from
  their history, being misinterpreted, were by the antient mythologists
  represented as so many dragons and monsters. Nonnus mentions both Arpe,
  and Campe in this light, and says that the latter had fifty heads, each
  of some different beast,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But Campe was an oracular temple and inclosure, sacred to Ham or Cham:
  where people used to exercise. The fifty heads related to the number of
  the priests, who there resided; and who were esteemed as so many wild
  beasts for their cruelty. Nonnus makes Jupiter kill Campe: but Diodorus
  Siculus gives the honour to Dionusus; who is supposed to have slain this
  monster at Zaborna in Libya; and to have raised over her, <span
  title="chôma pammegethes" class="grk">&#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>,
  a vast mound of earth. This heap of soil was in reality a high place or
  altar; which in after times was taken for a place of burial. These
  inclosures grew by degrees into disrepute; and the history of them
  obsolete. In consequence of which the <span title="taphoi" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>, or mounds, were supposed to
  be the tombs of heroes. The Grecians, who took every history to
  themselves, imagined, that their Jupiter and Dionusus, and their Hercules
  had slain them. But what they took for tombs of enemies were in reality
  altars to these very Gods; who were not confined to Greece, nor of
  Grecian original. The Campanians in Italy were an antient Amonian colony;
  and they were denominated from Campe or Campus, which was probably the
  first temple, they erected. Stephanus Byzantinus shews, that there was of
  old such a place: <span title="Kampos&mdash;ktisma Kampanou" class="grk"
  >&#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;&mdash;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;
  &#x39A;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>: but
  would insinuate that it took its name from a person the head of the
  colony. Eustathius more truly makes it give name to the people: though he
  is not sufficiently determinate. <a name="footnotetag775"

  contradistinction to the temples, which were covered. They are to be
  found in many parts of the world, where the Amonian religion obtained,
  which was propagated much farther than we are aware. In our island the
  exhibition of those manly sports in vogue among country people is called
  Camping: and the inclosures for that purpose, where they wrestle and
  contend, are called Camping closes. There are many of them in
  Cambridgeshire, as well as in other parts of the kingdom. In Germany we
  meet with the name of Kæmpenfelt; in which word there is no part derived
  from the Latin language: for the terms would then be synonymous, and one
  of them redundant. Kæmpenfelt was, I imagine, an antient name for a field
  of sports, and exercise, like the gymnasium of the Greeks: and a Camping
  place in Britain is of the like purport.</p>

  <p>It has been my uniform purpose, during the whole process, which I have
  made in my system, to shew, that the Grecians formed Deities out of
  titles; and that they often attributed to one person, what belonged to a
  people. And when they had completed the history, they generally took the
  merit of it to themselves. By means of this clue we may obtain an insight
  into some of the most remote, and the most obscure parts of antiquity.
  For many and great achievements have been attributed to heroes of the
  first ages, which it was not possible for them singly to have performed.
  And these actions, though in some degree diversified, and given to
  different personages, yet upon examination will be found to relate to one
  people or family; and to be at bottom one and the same history.</p>

<h3>OSIRIS.</h3>

  <p>If we consider the history of Osiris, he will appear a wonderful
  conqueror, who travelled over the face of the whole <a
  name="footnotetag776" href="#footnote776"><sup>[776]</sup></a>earth,
  winning new territories, wherever he came; yet always to the advantage of
  those whom he subdued. He is said to have been the son of Rhea: and his
  chief attendants in his peregrinations were Pan, Anubis, Macedo, with
  Maro, a great planter of vines; also Triptolemus much skilled in
  husbandry. The people of India claimed Osiris, as their own; and
  maintained, that he was born at Nusa in their <a name="footnotetag777"
  href="#footnote777"><sup>[777]</sup></a>country. Others supposed his
  birth-place to have been at Nusa in <a name="footnotetag778"
  href="#footnote778"><sup>[778]</sup></a>Arabia, where he first planted
  the vine. Many make him a native of Egypt: and mention the rout of his
  travels as commencing from that country through Arabia, and Ethiopia; and
  then to India, and the regions of the east. When he was arrived at the
  extremities of the ocean, he turned back, and passed through the upper
  provinces of Asia, till he came to the Hellespont, which he crossed. He
  then entered <a name="footnotetag779"
  href="#footnote779"><sup>[779]</sup></a>Thrace, with the King of which he
  had a severe encounter: yet he is said to have persevered in his rout
  westward, till he arrived at the fountains of the Ister. He was also in
  Italy, and Greece: from the former of which he expelled the giants near
  Phlegra in Campania. He visited many places upon the ocean: and though he
  is represented as at the head of an army; and his travels were attended
  with military operations; yet he is at the same time described with the
  Muses, and Sciences in his retinue. His march likewise was conducted with
  songs, and dances, and the sound of every instrument of music. He built
  cities in various parts; particularly <a name="footnotetag780"
  href="#footnote780"><sup>[780]</sup></a>Hecatompulos, which he
  denominated Theba, after the name of his mother. In every region, whither
  he came, he is said to have instructed the people in <a
  name="footnotetag781" href="#footnote781"><sup>[781]</sup></a>planting,
  and sowing, and other useful arts. He particularly introduced the vine:
  and where that was not adapted to the soil, he taught the natives the use
  of ferment, and shewed them the way to make <a name="footnotetag782"
  href="#footnote782"><sup>[782]</sup></a>wine of barley, little inferior
  to the juice of the grape. He was esteemed a great blessing to the
  Egyptians both as a <a name="footnotetag783"
  href="#footnote783"><sup>[783]</sup></a>Lawgiver, and a King. He first
  built temples to the Gods: and was reputed a general benefactor of <a
  name="footnotetag784" href="#footnote784"><sup>[784]</sup></a>mankind.
  After many years travel they represent him as returning to Egypt in great
  triumph, where after his death he was enshrined as a Deity. His Taphos,
  or high altar, was shewn in many places: in all which he in aftertimes
  was supposed to have been buried. The people of Memphis shewed one of
  them; whereon was a sacred pillar, containing a detail of his life, and
  great actions, to the following purport. <a name="footnotetag785"
  href="#footnote785"><sup>[785]</sup></a><i>My father was Cronus, the
  youngest of all the Gods. I am the king Osiris, who carried my arms over
  the face of the whole earth, till I arrived at the uninhabited parts of
  India. From thence I passed through the regions of the north to the
  fountain-head of the Ister. I visited also other remote countries; nor
  stopped till I came to the western ocean. I am the eldest son of Cronus;
  sprung from the genuine and respectable race of</i> (<span title="Sôos" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>) <i>Sous, and am related to the
  fountain of day. There is not a nation upon earth, where I have not been;
  and to whose good I have not contributed.</i></p>

  <p>This is a very curious piece of antient history: and it will be found
  to be in great measure true, if taken with this allowance, that what is
  here said to have been achieved by one person, was the work of many.
  Osiris was a title conferred upon more persons than one; by which means
  the history of the first ages has been in some degree confounded. In this
  description the Cuthites are alluded to, who carried on the expeditions
  here mentioned. They were one branch of the posterity of Ham; who is here
  spoken of as the eldest son of Cronus. How justly they conferred upon him
  this rank of primogeniture, I will not determine. By <a
  name="footnotetag786" href="#footnote786"><sup>[786]</sup></a>Cronus we
  are here to understand the same person, as is also represented under the
  name of Soüs. This would be more truly expressed <span title="Sôon" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, Soön; by which is meant the Sun:
  All the Amonian families affected to be styled Heliadæ, or the offspring
  of the Sun: and under this title they alluded to their great ancestor the
  father of all: as by Osiris they generally meant Ham. <span title="Sôon" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, Soön, is the same as <a
  name="footnotetag787" href="#footnote787"><sup>[787]</sup></a>Zoon, and
  Zoan, the fountain of day. The land of Zoan in Egypt was the nome of
  Heliopolis: and the city Zoan the place of the Sun. The person then
  styled here Soüs can be no other than the great Patriarch under a title
  of the Sun. He is accordingly by Philo Biblius called Ousoüs in an
  extract from Sanchoniathon. He makes him indeed reside, where Tyre was
  afterwards built; but supposes him to have lived at a time, when there
  were great rains and storms; and to have been the first constructor of a
  ship, and the first who ventured upon the <a name="footnotetag788"
  href="#footnote788"><sup>[788]</sup></a>seas. In respect to the travels
  of Osiris we shall find that the posterity of Ham did traverse at
  different times the regions above-mentioned: and in many of them took up
  their abode. They built the city Memphis in Egypt; also Hecatompulos,
  which they denominated Theba, after the name of their reputed mother.
  They also built Zoan, the city of the Sun.</p>

  <p>Osiris is a title often conferred upon the great patriarch himself:
  and there is no way to find out the person meant but by observing the
  history, which is subjoined. When we read of Osiris being exposed in an
  ark, and being afterward restored to day; of his planting the vine, and
  teaching mankind agriculture; and inculcating religion, and justice; the
  person alluded to stands too manifest to need any farther elucidation.
  And when it is said of Osiris, that he went over most parts of the
  habitable globe, and built cities in various regions; this too may be
  easily understood. It can allude to nothing else, but a people called
  Osirians, who traversed the regions mentioned. They were principally the
  Cuthites, who went abroad under various denominations: and the histories
  of all the great heroes, and heroïnes of the first ages will be found of
  the same purport, as the foregoing. Osiris is supposed to have been
  succeeded in Egypt by Orus. After Orus came Thoules; who was succeeded by
  <a name="footnotetag789"
  href="#footnote789"><sup>[789]</sup></a>Sesostris.</p>

<h3>PERSEUS.</h3>

  <p>Perseus was one of the most antient heroes in the mythology of Greece:
  the merit of whose supposed achievements the Helladians took to
  themselves; and gave out that he was a native of Argos. He travelled to
  the temple of <a name="footnotetag790"
  href="#footnote790"><sup>[790]</sup></a>Ammon; and from thence traversed
  the whole extent of Africa. He subdued the <a name="footnotetag791"
  href="#footnote791"><sup>[791]</sup></a>Gorgons, who lived in Mauritania,
  and at Tartessus in B&#339;tica; and defeated the Ethiopians upon the
  western ocean, and the nations about mount <i>Atlas</i>: which <a
  name="footnotetag792" href="#footnote792"><sup>[792]</sup></a>mountain he
  only and Hercules are said to have passed. Being arrived at the extremity
  of the continent, he found means to pass over, and to get possession of
  all the western islands. He warred in the East; where he freed <a
  name="footnotetag793" href="#footnote793"><sup>[793]</sup></a>Andromeda,
  the daughter of Cepheus king of the eastern Ethiopia, who was exposed to
  a sea-monster. Some imagine this to have happened at <a
  name="footnotetag794" href="#footnote794"><sup>[794]</sup></a>Joppa in
  Palestine, where the <a name="footnotetag795"
  href="#footnote795"><sup>[795]</sup></a>bones of this monster of an
  extraordinary size are supposed to have been for a long time preserved.
  He is said to have built <a name="footnotetag796"
  href="#footnote796"><sup>[796]</sup></a>Tarsus in Cilicia, reputed the
  most antient city in the world; and to have planted the peach tree at <a
  name="footnotetag797" href="#footnote797"><sup>[797]</sup></a>Memphis.
  The Persians were supposed to have been his descendants. He travelled
  through Asia Minor, to the country of the <a name="footnotetag798"
  href="#footnote798"><sup>[798]</sup></a>Hyperboreans upon the Ister, and
  the lake Mæotis; and from thence descended to Greece. Here he built
  Mycene, and Tiryns, said by many to have been the work of the Cyclopians.
  He established a seminary at Helicon: and was the founder of those
  families, which were styled Dorian, and Herculean. It is a doubt among
  writers, whether he came into Italy. Some of his family were there; who
  defeated the giant race in Campania, and who afterwards built Argiletum,
  and Ardea in Latium. Virgil supposes it to have been effected by Danae,
  the mother of this Hero:</p>

  <p>But <a name="footnotetag800"
  href="#footnote800"><sup>[800]</sup></a>Servius says, that Perseus
  himself in his childhood was driven to the coast of Daunia. He is
  represented as the ancestor of the Grecian Hercules, supposed to have
  been born at Thebes in B&#339;otia. In reality neither <a
  name="footnotetag801" href="#footnote801"><sup>[801]</sup></a>Hercules,
  nor Perseus, was of Grecian original; notwithstanding the genealogies
  framed in that country. The history of the latter came apparently from
  Egypt, as we may learn from Diodorus<a name="footnotetag802"
  href="#footnote802"><sup>[802]</sup></a>: <span title="Phasi de kai ton Persea gegonenai kat' Aigupton." class="grk"

  Herodotus more truly represents him as an <a name="footnotetag803"
  href="#footnote803"><sup>[803]</sup></a>Assyrian; by which is meant a
  Babylonian: and agreeably to this he is said to have married <a
  name="footnotetag804" href="#footnote804"><sup>[804]</sup></a>Asterie,
  the daughter of Belus, the same as Astaroth and Astarte of Canaan; by
  whom he had a daughter Hecate. This, though taken from an idle system of
  theology, yet plainly shews, that the history of Perseus had been greatly
  misapplied and lowered, by being inserted among the fables of Greece.
  Writers speak of him as a great <a name="footnotetag805"
  href="#footnote805"><sup>[805]</sup></a>Astronomer, and a person of
  uncommon knowledge. He instructed mariners to direct their way in the sea
  by the lights of heaven; and particularly by the polar constellation.
  This he first observed, and gave it the name of Helice. Though he was
  represented as a Babylonian; yet he resided in Egypt, and is said to have
  reigned at Memphis. To say the truth, he was worshipped at that place:
  for Perseus was a title of the Deity; <a name="footnotetag806"

  href="#footnote807"><sup>[807]</sup></a>Chemmis, as well as at Memphis,
  and in other parts of Egypt. Upon the Heracleotic branch of the Nile,
  near the sea, was a celebrated watch-tower, denominated from him. His
  true name was Perez, or Parez, rendered Peresis, Perses, and Perseus: and
  in the account given of this personage we have the history of the
  Peresians, Parrhasians, and Perezites, in their several peregrinations;
  who were no other than the Heliadæ, and Osirians abovementioned. It is a
  mixed history, in which their forefathers are alluded to; particularly
  their great progenitor, the father of mankind. He was supposed to have
  had a renewal of life: they therefore described Perseus as inclosed in an
  <a name="footnotetag808" href="#footnote808"><sup>[808]</sup></a>ark, and
  exposed in a state of childhood upon the waters, after having been
  conceived in a shower of gold.</p>

  <p>Bochart thinks that the name both of Persis and Perseus was from <span
  lang="he" title="PRS" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;&#x5E8;&#x5E1;</bdo></span>,
  Paras, an Horse: because the Persians were celebrated horsemen, and took
  great delight in that animal. But it must be considered that the name is
  very antient, and prior to this use of horses. P'aras, P'arez, and
  P'erez, however diversified, signify the Sun; and are of the same analogy
  as P'ur, P'urrhos, P'oros, which betoken fire. Every animal, which was in
  any degree appropriated to a Deity, was called by some sacred <a
  name="footnotetag809" href="#footnote809"><sup>[809]</sup></a>title.
  Hence an horse was called P'arez: and the same name, but without the
  prefix, was given to a lion by many nations in the east. It was at first
  only a mark of reference, and betokened a solar animal, specifying the
  particular Deity to whom it was sacred. There were many nations, which
  were distinguished in the same manner; some of whom the Greeks styled
  Parrhasians. Hence the antient Arcadians, those Selenitæ, who were
  undoubtedly an Amonian colony, had this appellation. A people in Elis had
  the same. The Poets described the constellation of Helice, or the Bear,
  by the title of Parrhasis, Arctos, and Parrhasis Ursa. This asterism was
  confessedly first taken notice of by Perez or Perseus, by which is meant
  the Persians.</p>

  <p>In the east, where the worship of Arez greatly prevailed, there were
  to be found many nations called after this manner. Part of Media,
  according to <a name="footnotetag811"
  href="#footnote811"><sup>[811]</sup></a>Polybius, had the name of
  Parrhasia. There were also Parrhasii and Parrhasini in <a

  href="#footnote815"><sup>[815]</sup></a>Parrhasians in Greece were the
  same as the Dorians and Heraclidæ; all alike Cuthites, as were the
  antient Persians. Hence it is truly said by Plato, that the Heraclidæ in
  Greece, and the Achæmenidæ among the Persians were of the same stock: <a

<h3>OF MYRINA,</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">AND THE</p>

<h3>AMAZONIANS OF LIBYA.</h3>

  <p>From a notion that the Amazons were a community of women, historians
  have represented the chief personage of their nation as a <a
  name="footnotetag819" href="#footnote819"><sup>[819]</sup></a>female. She
  is mentioned by some as having flourished long before the æra of <a
  name="footnotetag820" href="#footnote820"><sup>[820]</sup></a>Troy: and
  it is by others said more precisely, that she lived in the time of Orus,
  the son of Isis and Osiris. This removes her history far back; so as to
  make it coeval with the first annals of time. Her dominions lay in the
  most western parts of <a name="footnotetag821"
  href="#footnote821"><sup>[821]</sup></a>Africa, at the extremity of
  Atlas; where the mountain terminated in the ocean, to which it gave name.
  This country was called Mauritania; and was supposed to have been
  possessed by the Atlantes and Gorgons. The Grecian writers, who did not
  know that the same family went under different titles, have often made
  the same nation at variance with itself. And as they imagined every
  migration to have been a warlike expedition, they have represented Myrina
  as making great conquests; and what is extraordinary, going over the same
  ground, only in a retrograde direction, which Osiris had just passed
  before. Her first engagement was with the Atlantes of Cercene: against
  whom she marched with an army of 30,000 foot, and 2,000 horse; whom she
  completely armed with the skins of serpents. Having defeated the
  Atlantes, she marched against the Gorgons, whom she likewise <a
  name="footnotetag822" href="#footnote822"><sup>[822]</sup></a>conquered;
  and proceeding forward, subdued the greater part of Africa, till she
  arrived at the borders of Egypt. Having entered into an alliance with
  Orus, she passed the Nile, and invaded the Arabians, whom she defeated.
  She then conquered the Syrians, and Cilicians, and all the nations about
  Mount Taurus; till she arrived at Phrygia, and the regions about the
  river Caïcus. Here she built many cities, particularly Cuma, Pitane, and
  Priene. She also got possession of several islands; and among others, of
  Lesbos and Samothracia, in which last she founded an asylum. After these
  transactions, Myrina, accompanied with Mopsus the diviner, made an
  expedition into Thrace, which was the ultimate of her progress; for she
  was supposed to have been here slain. According to Homer she died in
  Phrygia: for he takes notice of her tomb in the plains of Troas; and
  represents it as a notable performance.</p>

  <p>The tomb of this heroïne was in reality a sacred mound, or high altar;
  and Myrina a Gentile divinity. In her supposed conquests we may in great
  measure see the history of Osiris, and Perseus, reversed, and in some
  degree abridged; yet not so far varied, but that the purport may be
  plainly discerned. Indeed there is no other way to obtain the hidden
  meaning, but by collating the different histories, and bringing them in
  one view under the eye of the reader.</p>

<h3>HERCULES.</h3>

  <p>Similar to the foregoing are the expeditions of Hercules, and the
  conquests which he is supposed to have performed. After many exploits in
  Greece, the reputed place of his nativity, he travelled as far as mount
  Caucasus near Colchis, to free Prometheus, who was there exposed to an
  eagle or vulture. Upon the Thermodon he engaged with the Amazons, whom he
  utterly defeated; and then passed over into Thrace. Upon his return into
  Greece he was ordered to make an expedition into Iberia, a region in the
  farthest part of Spain; where Chrusaor, a prince of great wealth,
  resided. Hercules accepts of the commission; but, I know not for what
  reason, goes first to Crete, and from thence to <a name="footnotetag824"
  href="#footnote824"><sup>[824]</sup></a>Libya; and what is extraordinary,
  proceeds to Egypt. This makes the plan of his supposed rout somewhat
  irregular and unaccountable. After some time spent in these parts, he
  builds the city Hecatompulos, said before to have been built by Osiris:
  and then traverses the whole of Africa westward, till he arrives at the
  Fretum Gaditanum. Here he erects two pillars; which being finished, he at
  last enters Iberia. He defeats the sons of Chrusaor, who were in arms to
  oppose him; and bestows their kingdom upon others. He likewise seizes
  upon the oxen of Geryon. He then marches into the country of the Celtæ,
  and <a name="footnotetag825"
  href="#footnote825"><sup>[825]</sup></a>founds the city Corunna, and
  likewise <a name="footnotetag826"
  href="#footnote826"><sup>[826]</sup></a>Alesia in Gaul. He afterwards
  fights with the giants Albion and Bergion near Arelate, in the plain
  styled Campus Lapideus; where are the salt waters of Salona. He then
  passes the <a name="footnotetag827"
  href="#footnote827"><sup>[827]</sup></a>Alpes; and upon the banks of the
  Eridanus encounters a person of shepherd race; whom he kills, and seizes
  his <a name="footnotetag828"
  href="#footnote828"><sup>[828]</sup></a>golden flocks. In his way
  homeward he visits Hetruria, and arrives at the mountain Palatinus upon
  the Tiber. From thence he goes to the maritime part of Campania, about
  Cuma, Heraclea, and the lake Aornon. Not far from hence was an adust and
  fiery region; supposed to have been the celebrated Phlegra, where the
  giants warred against heaven: in which war Hercules is said to have <a
  name="footnotetag829" href="#footnote829"><sup>[829]</sup></a>assisted.
  Here was an antient oracular temple; and hard by the mountain Vesuvius,
  which in those days flamed violently, though it did not for many ages
  afterwards. During his residence here he visited the hot fountains near
  Misenus and Dicæarchea; and made a large causeway, called in aftertimes
  Via Herculanea, and Agger Puteolanus. After having visited the Locrians,
  and the people of Rhegium, he crossed the sea to Sicily; which sea he
  swam over, holding by the horn of an ox. At his arrival some warm springs
  burst forth miraculously, to give him an opportunity of bathing. Here he
  boxed with Eryx; defeated the Sicani; and performed many other exploits.
  What is remarkable, having in Spain seized upon the cattle of Geryon, he
  is said to have made them travel over the Pyrenean mountains, and
  afterwards over the Alpes, into Italy; and from thence cross the sea into
  Sicily; and being now about to leave that island, he swims with them
  again to Rhegium: and ranging up the coast of the Adriatic, passes round
  to Illyria, from thence to Epirus; and so descends to Greece. The whole
  of these travels is said to have been completed in ten years.</p>

  <p>He was also reported, according to <a name="footnotetag830"
  href="#footnote830"><sup>[830]</sup></a>Megasthenes and others, to have
  made an expedition into <a name="footnotetag831"
  href="#footnote831"><sup>[831]</sup></a>India, and to have left many
  memorials of his transactions in those parts. He travelled likewise into
  the region called afterwards Scythia; the natives of which country were
  his <a name="footnotetag832"
  href="#footnote832"><sup>[832]</sup></a>descendants. He also visited the
  Hyperboreans. In all these peregrinations he is generally described as
  proceeding alone: at least we have no intimation of any army to assist in
  the performance of these great enterprises. He is indeed supposed to have
  sailed with six ships to <a name="footnotetag833"
  href="#footnote833"><sup>[833]</sup></a>Phrygia: but how he came by them
  is not said; nor whence he raised the men, who went with him. At other
  times he is represented with a club in his hand, and the skin of an
  animal upon his shoulders. When he passed over the ocean, he is said to
  have been wafted in a golden <a name="footnotetag834"
  href="#footnote834"><sup>[834]</sup></a>bowl. In Phrygia he freed Hesione
  from a Cetus, or sea monster, just as Perseus delivered Andromeda. He is
  mentioned as founding many cities in parts very remote: the sea-coast of
  B&#339;tica, and Cantabria, was, according to some writers, peopled by <a
  name="footnotetag835" href="#footnote835"><sup>[835]</sup></a>him. By
  Syncellus he is said to have resided in Italy, and to have reigned in <a
  name="footnotetag836" href="#footnote836"><sup>[836]</sup></a>Latium. The
  Grecians supposed that he was burnt upon Mount &#338;ta: but the people
  of Gades shewed his Taphos in their <a name="footnotetag837"
  href="#footnote837"><sup>[837]</sup></a>city, just as the Egyptians
  shewed the Taphos of Osiris at Memphis, and elsewhere. Hence it was
  imagined by many, that Hercules was buried at Gades. The philosopher
  Megaclides could not be brought to give the least assent to the histories
  of this <a name="footnotetag838"
  href="#footnote838"><sup>[838]</sup></a>hero: and Strabo seems to have
  thought a great part of them to have been a <a name="footnotetag839"
  href="#footnote839"><sup>[839]</sup></a>fable. In short, the whole
  account of this personage is very inconsistent: and though writers have
  tried to compromise matters by supposing more persons than one of this
  name, yet the whole is still incredible, and can never be so adjusted as
  to merit the least belief. How they multiplied the same Deity, in order
  to remedy their faulty mythology, may be seen in the following extract
  from Cicero. <a name="footnotetag840"
  href="#footnote840"><sup>[840]</sup></a>Quanquam, quem potissimum
  Herculem colamus, scire velim: plures enim nobis tradunt ii, qui
  interiores scrutantur et reconditas literas. Antiquissimum Jove natum,
  sed item Jove antiquissimo: nam Joves quoque plures in priscis Græcorum
  literis invenimus. Ex eo igitur et Lysito est is Hercules, quem
  concertâsse cum Apolline de tripode accepimus. Alter traditur Nilo natus,
  Ægyptius; quem aiunt Phrygias literas conscripsisse. Tertius est ex Idæis
  Dactylis, cui inferias afferunt. Quartus Jovis est, et Asteriæ, Latonæ
  sororis, quem Tyrii maxime colunt; cujus Carthaginem filium ferunt.
  Quintus in <a name="footnotetag841"
  href="#footnote841"><sup>[841]</sup></a>Indiâ, qui Belus dicitur. Sextus

  docebo, plures Joves accepimus.</p>

  <p>Hercules was a title given to the chief deity of the Gentiles, who
  have been multiplied into almost as many personages, as there were
  countries, where he was worshipped. What has been attributed to this god
  singly, was the work of Herculeans; a people who went under this title
  among the many which they assumed; and who were the same as the Osirians,
  Peresians, and Cuthites. They built Tartessus in B&#339;tica, and
  occupied great part of Iberia. They likewise founded <a
  name="footnotetag842" href="#footnote842"><sup>[842]</sup></a>Corunna in
  Cantabria, and <a name="footnotetag843"
  href="#footnote843"><sup>[843]</sup></a>Alesia in Gaul: of which there
  are traditions to this day. Some of them settled near <a
  name="footnotetag844" href="#footnote844"><sup>[844]</sup></a>Arelate;
  others among the <a name="footnotetag845"
  href="#footnote845"><sup>[845]</sup></a>Alpes: also at Cuma, and Heraclea
  in Campania. They were also to be found at Tyre, and in Egypt; and even
  in the remotest parts of <a name="footnotetag846"
  href="#footnote846"><sup>[846]</sup></a>India. In short, wherever there
  were Heraclidæ, or Herculeans, an Hercules has been supposed. Hence his
  character has been variously represented. One, while he appears little
  better than a sturdy vagrant; at other times he is mentioned as a great
  benefactor; also as the patron of science, the <a name="footnotetag847"
  href="#footnote847"><sup>[847]</sup></a>God of eloquence, with the Muses
  in his train. On this account he had the title of <a
  name="footnotetag848" href="#footnote848"><sup>[848]</sup></a>Musagetes;
  and the Roman general Fulvius dedicated a temple which he had erected to
  his honour, and inscribed it <a name="footnotetag849"
  href="#footnote849"><sup>[849]</sup></a><i>Herculi Musarum</i>. There are
  gems, upon which he is represented as presiding among the Deities of <a
  name="footnotetag850" href="#footnote850"><sup>[850]</sup></a>Science. He
  is said to have been swallowed by a Cetus, or large fish, from which he
  was after some time delivered. This history will hereafter be easily
  decyphered. He was the chief deity of the <a name="footnotetag851"
  href="#footnote851"><sup>[851]</sup></a>Gentile world; the same as
  Hermes, Osiris, and Dionusus; and his rites were introduced into various
  parts by the Cuthites. In the detail of his peregrinations is contained,
  in great measure, an history of that people, and of their settlements.
  Each of these the Greeks have described as a warlike expedition; and have
  taken the glory of it to themselves. He is said to have had many sons.
  One of these was <a name="footnotetag852"
  href="#footnote852"><sup>[852]</sup></a>Archemagoras; by which is meant
  the father or chief of the Magi. There are many others enumerated: the
  principal of whom are said to have been; <a name="footnotetag853"
  href="#footnote853"><sup>[853]</sup></a>Sardus, or Sardon; Cyrnus,
  Gelonus, Olynthus, Scythus, Galathus, Lydus, Iberus, Celtus, Poimen. As
  these are all manifestly the names of nations, we may perceive by the
  purport of this history, that the Sardinians, Corsicans, Iberians, Celtæ,
  Galatæ, Scythæ, &amp;c. &amp;c. together with those styled Shepherds,
  were Herculeans; all descended from that <a name="footnotetag854"
  href="#footnote854"><sup>[854]</sup></a>Hercules, who was the father of
  Archemagoras the chief of the Magi.</p>

<h3>DIONUSUS.</h3>

  <p>The history of Dionusus is closely connected with that of Bacchus,
  though they were two distinct persons. It is said of the former, that he
  was born at <a name="footnotetag855"
  href="#footnote855"><sup>[855]</sup></a>Nusa in Arabia: but the people
  upon the Indus insisted, that he was a native of their <a
  name="footnotetag856" href="#footnote856"><sup>[856]</sup></a>country;
  and that the city Nusa, near mount Meru, was the true place of his birth.
  There were, however, some among them, who allowed, that he came into
  their parts from the west; and that his arrival was in the most antient
  times. He taught the nations, whither he came, to build and to plant, and
  to enter into societies. To effect this, he collected the various
  families out of the villages in which they dwelt, and made them
  incorporate in towns and cities, which he built in the most commodious
  situations. After they were thus established, he gave them laws, and
  instructed them in the worship of the Gods. He also taught them to plant
  the Vine, and to extract the juice of the grape; together with much other
  salutary knowledge. This he did throughout all his <a
  name="footnotetag857" href="#footnote857"><sup>[857]</sup></a>travels,
  till he had conquered every region in the East. Nor was it in these parts
  only, that he shewed himself so beneficent a conqueror; but over all the
  habitable <a name="footnotetag858"
  href="#footnote858"><sup>[858]</sup></a>world. The account given by the
  Egyptians is consonant to that of the Indians: only they suppose him to
  have been of their own country; and to have set out by the way of Arabia
  and the Red Sea, till he arrived at the extremities of the East. He
  travelled also into <a name="footnotetag859"
  href="#footnote859"><sup>[859]</sup></a>Lybia, quite to the Atlantic; of
  which performance Thymætes is said to have given an account in an antient
  Phrygian poem. After his Indian expedition, which took him up three
  years, he passed from Asia by the Hellespont into Thrace, where Lycurgus
  withstood him, and at last put him to flight. He came into Greece; and
  was there adopted by the people, and represented as a native of their
  country. He visited many places upon the Mediterranean; especially
  Campania, and the coast of Italy, where he was taken prisoner by the
  Hetrurian pirates. Others say, that he conquered all <a
  name="footnotetag860" href="#footnote860"><sup>[860]</sup></a>Hetruria.
  He had many attendants; among whom were the Tityri, Satyri, Thyades, and
  Amazons. The whole of his history is very inconsistent in respect both to
  time and place. Writers therefore have tried to remedy this by
  introducing different people of the same name. Hence Dionusus is
  multiplied into as many <a name="footnotetag861"
  href="#footnote861"><sup>[861]</sup></a>personages as Hercules. His
  history was looked upon as very interesting; and therefore was the chief
  theme of all the antient <a name="footnotetag862"
  href="#footnote862"><sup>[862]</sup></a>bards. His flight, styled <span
  title="phugê Dionusou" class="grk">&#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3B3;&#x3B7;
  &#x394;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>, was

  <i>The Egyptians</i>, says <a name="footnotetag864"
  href="#footnote864"><sup>[864]</sup></a>Diodorus, <i>maintain that their
  God Osiris is no other than the Dionusus of Greece: And they farther
  mention, that he travelled over the face of the whole earth&mdash;In like
  manner the Indi assure us, that it is the same Deity, who wan conversant
  in their <a name="footnotetag865"
  href="#footnote865"><sup>[865]</sup></a>country</i>.</p>

  <p>Dionusus, according to the Grecian mythology, is represented as having
  been twice born: and is said to have had two fathers and two mothers. He
  was also exposed in an <a name="footnotetag866"
  href="#footnote866"><sup>[866]</sup></a>ark, and wonderfully preserved.
  The purport of which histories is plain. We must however for the most
  part consider the account given of Dionusus, as the history of the
  Dionusians. This is twofold. Part relates to their rites and religion; in
  which the great events of the infant world, and the preservation of
  mankind in general, were recorded. In the other part, which contains the
  expeditions and conquests of this personage, are enumerated the various
  colonies of the people, who were denominated from him. They were the same
  as the Osirians and Herculeans; all of one family, though under different
  appellations. I have shewn, that there were many places which claimed his
  birth; and as many, where was shewn the spot of his interment. Of these
  we may find samples in Egypt, Arabia, and India; as well as in Africa,
  Greece, and its islands. For the Grecians, wherever they met with a grot
  or a cavern sacred to him, took it for granted that he was born there:
  and wherever he had a taphos, or high altar, supposed that he was there
  <a name="footnotetag867" href="#footnote867"><sup>[867]</sup></a>buried.
  The same is also observable in the history of all the Gods.</p>

  <p>From what has been said we may perceive that the same history has been
  appropriated to different personages: and if we look farther into the
  annals of the first ages, we shall find more instances to the same
  purpose. It is said of <a name="footnotetag868"
  href="#footnote868"><sup>[868]</sup></a>Cronus, and Astarte, that they
  went over the whole earth; disposing of the countries at their pleasure,
  and doing good wherever they came. Cronus in consequence of it is
  represented as an universal <a name="footnotetag869"
  href="#footnote869"><sup>[869]</sup></a>benefactor; who reclaimed men
  from their savage way of life, and taught them to pass their days in
  innocence and truth. A like account is given of Ouranus, the great king
  of the <a name="footnotetag870"
  href="#footnote870"><sup>[870]</sup></a>Atlantians, who observing mankind
  in an unsettled and barbarous state, set about building cities for their
  reception; and rendered them more humane and civilized by his
  institutions and laws. His influence was very extensive; as he is
  supposed to have had the greater part of the world under his rule. All
  this, and what was above done by Cronus and Astarte, the Grecians
  attributed to Apollo and Themis. Strabo mentions from the historian,
  Ephorus, that the oracle at Delphi was founded by these two <a
  name="footnotetag871" href="#footnote871"><sup>[871]</sup></a>deities at
  the time, when Apollo was going over the world doing good to all mankind.
  He taught the nations, where he came, to be more <a name="footnotetag872"
  href="#footnote872"><sup>[872]</sup></a>gentle and humane in their
  manners; and to abstain from their wild fruits, and foul banquets:
  affording them instructions how to improve themselves by cultivation.</p>

  <p>Some of these persons are mentioned as proceeding in a pacific manner:
  but these peregrinations in general are represented as a process of war;
  and all that was effected, was supposed to have been by conquest. Thus
  Osiris, Hercules, Perseus, Dionusus, displayed their benevolence sword in
  hand: and laid every country under an obligation to the limits of the
  earth. The like is said of Zeuth, the Zeus of Greece, who was an
  universal conqueror and benefactor: <a name="footnotetag873"

  <i>After him</i> (that is, Söus, or Sosis,) <i>came Osiris; and then
  Orus: to whom succeeded Thoules, who conquered the whole earth quite to

  name="footnotetag875" href="#footnote875"><sup>[875]</sup></a>Suidas, and
  by the author of the <a name="footnotetag876"
  href="#footnote876"><sup>[876]</sup></a>Chronicon Paschale.</p>

  <p>These accounts I have collated, and brought in succession to one
  another; that we may at a view see the absurdity of the history, if taken
  in the common acceptation. And however numerous my instances may have
  been, I shall introduce other examples before I quit the subject. I must
  particularly speak of an Egyptian hero, equally ideal with those
  abovementioned; whose history, though the most romantic and improbable of
  any, has been admitted as credible and true. The person to whom I allude,
  is the celebrated Sesostris. Most of the antient historians speak of his
  great achievements; and the most learned of the modern chronologists have
  endeavoured to determine his æra, and point out the time of his reign.
  But their endeavours have been fruitless; and they vary about the time
  when he lived not less than a thousand years: nay, some differ even more
  than this in the æra, which they assign to him.</p>

<h3>SESOSTRIS.</h3>

  <p>Among the writers who have written concerning this extraordinary
  personage, Diodorus Siculus is the most uniform and full; and with his
  evidence I will begin my account. He<a name="footnotetag877"
  href="#footnote877"><sup>[877]</sup></a> informs us, that, when this
  prince was a youth, he was entrusted by his father with a great army. He
  upon this invaded Arabia: and though he was obliged to encounter hunger
  and thirst in the wilds, which he traversed; yet he subdued the whole of
  that large tract of country. He was afterwards sent far into the west;
  where he conquered all the legions of Lybia, and annexed great part of
  that country to the kingdom of Egypt. After the death of his father he
  formed a resolution to subdue all the nations upon earth. Accordingly,
  having settled everything at home, and appointed governors to each
  province, he set out with an army of six hundred thousand foot, and
  twenty-four thousand horse, and twenty-seven thousand armed chariots.
  With these he invaded the Ethiopians to the south; whom he defeated, and
  made tributaries to Egypt. He then built a fleet of ships upon the Red
  sea: and he is recorded as the first person who constructed vessels fit
  for distant navigation. With these, by means of his generals, he subdued
  all the sea-coast of Arabia, and all the coast upon the ocean as far as
  India. In the mean time he marched in person, with a puissant army, by
  land, and conquered the whole continent of Asia. He not only overran the
  countries, which Alexander afterwards invaded; but crossed both the Indus
  and the Ganges; and from thence penetrated to the eastern ocean. He then
  turned to the north, and attacked the nations of Scythia; till he at last
  arrived at the Tanäis, which divides Europe and Asia. Here he founded a
  colony; leaving behind him some of his people, as he had just before done
  at <a name="footnotetag878"
  href="#footnote878"><sup>[878]</sup></a>Colchis. These nations are said
  to the last to have retained memorials of their original from Egypt.
  About the same time Asia Minor, and most of the islands near it, fell
  into his hands. He at last passed into <a name="footnotetag879"
  href="#footnote879"><sup>[879]</sup></a>Thrace, where he is said to have
  been brought into some difficulties. He however persisted, and subdued
  all the regions of Europe. In most of these countries he erected pillars
  with hieroglyphical inscriptions; denoting that these parts of the world
  had been subdued by the great Sesostris, or, as <a name="footnotetag880"
  href="#footnote880"><sup>[880]</sup></a>Diodorus expresses his name,
  Sesoosis. He likewise erected statues of himself, formed of stone, with a
  bow and a lance: which statues were in length four cubits and four palms,
  according to the dimensions of his own height and stature. Having thus
  finished his career of <a name="footnotetag881"
  href="#footnote881"><sup>[881]</sup></a>victory, he returned laden with
  spoils to Egypt, after an absence of <a name="footnotetag882"
  href="#footnote882"><sup>[882]</sup></a>nine years; which is one year
  less than was attributed to the expeditions of Hercules.</p>

  <p>The detail given by this historian is very plain and precise: and we
  proceed very regularly and minutely in a geographical series from one
  conquest to another: so that the story is rendered in some degree
  plausible. But we may learn from Diodorus himself, that little credit is
  to be paid to this narration, after all the pains he may have taken to
  win upon our credulity. He ingenuously owns, that not only the Grecian
  writers, but even the priests of Egypt, and the bards of the same country
  varied in the accounts which they gave of this hero; and were guilty of
  great inconsistence. It was therefore his chief labour to collect what he
  thought most credible, and what appeared most consonant to the memorials
  in Egypt, which time had spared: <a name="footnotetag883"
  href="#footnote883"><sup>[883]</sup></a><span title="Ta pithanôtata, kai tois uparchousin eti kata tên chôran sêmeiois ta malista sumphônounta dielthein." class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;,
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;
  &#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B9; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1; &#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C7;&#x3C9;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C3;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;.</span> But, as
  these memorials consisted chiefly in hieroglyphics, I do not see how it
  was possible for Diodorus to understand what the bards and priests could
  not decypher. The adjustment of this history, had it been practicable,
  should have been the work of a native Egyptian, and not of a person
  either from Greece or Sicily. This writer afterwards mentions the mighty
  <a name="footnotetag884" href="#footnote884"><sup>[884]</sup></a>works of
  Sesostris upon his return into Egypt: the temples which he built, and the
  great entrenchments which he made to the east, to guard the country from
  the Arabians: and having enumerated the whole of his actions, he
  concludes with an ingenuous confession, that <a name="footnotetag885"
  href="#footnote885"><sup>[885]</sup></a>little could be obtained that was
  precisely true. He has, without doubt, culled the most probable
  achievements of this hero; and coloured and arranged them to the best
  advantage: yet they still exceed belief. And if, after this care and
  disposition, they seem incredible, how would they appear in the garb, in
  which he found them? Yet the history of this personage has been admitted
  as credible by the most learned <a name="footnotetag886"
  href="#footnote886"><sup>[886]</sup></a>writers and chronologists:
  though, as I before mentioned, they cannot determine the æra of his reign
  within a thousand years. Sir John Marsham and Sir Isaac Newton suppose
  him to have been the Sesac of the scriptures; and consequently bring his
  reign down to the time of Rehoboam king of Judah. But the only reason for
  this, as far as I can perceive, seems to be, that Sesostris is
  represented as a great conqueror; and Sesac is presumed, from his large
  <a name="footnotetag887" href="#footnote887"><sup>[887]</sup></a>army, to
  have been so likewise. But there is nothing more said of Sesac, than that
  he formed a plan of conquering the king of Judah; and accordingly came
  with the army before mentioned, to put his design in execution. But the
  <a name="footnotetag888" href="#footnote888"><sup>[888]</sup></a>capital
  being delivered into his hands without the least resistance, and the king
  intirely submitting himself to his will; he contented himself with the
  rich plunder, which he found, and which he carried away at his departure.
  We may also infer from the servitude, to which the people of Judah were
  reduced, that he imposed upon them some future contributions.</p>

  <p>This is the whole of the history of Sesac, or Shishak; by whom no
  other expedition was undertaken that we know of: nor is there mention
  made upon record of a single battle which he fought. Yet from a notion
  that Sesac was a great warrior, he is made the same as Sesostris: and the
  age of the latter is brought down very many centuries beneath the æra, to
  which the best writers have adjudged it. When we differ from received
  tradition, we should not pass over in silence what is said on the
  contrary part; but give it at large, and then shew our reasons for our
  departure from it. I have taken notice of the supposed conquerors of the
  earth: and among them of the reputed deities of Egypt, who came under the
  names of Osiris, Perseus, Thoules, &amp;c. These are supposed, if they
  ever existed, to have lived in the first ages of the world, when Egypt
  was in its infant state; and Sesostris is made one of their number. He is
  by some placed after Orus; by others after Thoules; but still referred to
  the first ages. He is represented under the name of Sethos, <a
  name="footnotetag889" href="#footnote889"><sup>[889]</sup></a>Sethosis,
  Sesoosis, Sesonchosis, Sesostris; but the history, with which these names
  are accompanied, shews plainly the identity of the personage. Eusebius in
  reckoning up the dynasty of kings, who reigned after Hephaistus or
  Vulcan, mentions them in the following order: <a name="footnotetag890"
  href="#footnote890"><sup>[890]</sup></a><i>Then succeeded his son Helius;
  after him Sosis, then Osiris, then Orus, then Thoules, who conquered the
  whole earth to the ocean; and last of all Sesostris</i>. The <a
  name="footnotetag891" href="#footnote891"><sup>[891]</sup></a>Scholiast
  upon Apollonius Rhodius calls him Sesonchosis; and places him immediately
  after Orus, and the third in succession from Osiris: giving at the same
  time an account of his conquests. He adds that he was the person whom
  Theopompus called Sesostris. The same Scholiast quotes a curious passage
  from Dicæarchus, in which Sesonchosis maintains the same rank, and was
  consequently of the highest antiquity. <a name="footnotetag892"
  href="#footnote892"><sup>[892]</sup></a><i>Dicæarchus in the first book
  of his history mentions, that immediately after the reign of Orus, the
  son of Isis and Osiris, in Egypt, the government devolved to Sesonchosis:
  so that from the time of Sesonchosis to Nilus were two thousand
  years</i>. Cedrenus <a name="footnotetag893"
  href="#footnote893"><sup>[893]</sup></a>calls him Sesostris; and mentions
  him after Osiris, and Orus, and Thoules; which last was by the above
  writer omitted. <span title="Osiris. Ôros. Thoulês. meta de touton Sesôstris." class="grk"

  &#x3A3;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3C9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;.</span>
  The author of the Chronicon Paschale makes Orus to have been succeeded by
  the same personage, as is mentioned above, whom he calls Thoulis; and
  next to him introduces Sesostris. He relates all his great conquests; and
  gives us this farther information, that this prince was the first of the
  line of Ham, who reigned in Egypt; in other words, he was the first king
  of the country. <a name="footnotetag894"

  Aristotle speaks of Sesostris; but does not determine the time of his
  reign on account of its great antiquity. He only says that it was long
  before the age of <a name="footnotetag896"
  href="#footnote896"><sup>[896]</sup></a>Minos, who was supposed to have
  reigned in Crete. Apollonius Rhodius, who is thought to have been a
  native of Egypt, speaks of the great actions of this prince; but mentions
  no name: not knowing, I imagine, by which properly to distinguish him, as
  he was represented under so many. He however attributes to him every
  thing which is said of <a name="footnotetag897"
  href="#footnote897"><sup>[897]</sup></a>Sesostris; particularly the
  settling a Colony at Colchis, and building innumerable cities in the
  countries which he traversed:</p>

  </div>
  <p>He represents him as conquering all Asia and Europe; and this in times
  so remote, that many of the cities which he built, were in ruins before
  the æra of the Argonauts.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, we may perceive that if such a person as
  Sesostris had existed, his reign must have been of the earliest date. He
  is by some represented as succeeding Thoules: according to others he
  comes one degree higher, being introduced after <a name="footnotetag898"
  href="#footnote898"><sup>[898]</sup></a>Orus, who in the catalogue of
  Panodorus is placed first of the Demigods, that reigned in Egypt; but by
  <a name="footnotetag899"
  href="#footnote899"><sup>[899]</sup></a>Herodotus is ranked among the
  deities. According to Dicæarchus the reign of Sesostris was two thousand
  five hundred years before Nilus: and the reign of the latter was four
  hundred and thirty-six years before the first Olympiad. I do not place
  the least confidence in these computations; but would only shew from them
  that the person spoken of must be referred to the mythic age, to the æra
  of the Demigods of Egypt. Some of these evidences are taken notice of by
  Sir John <a name="footnotetag900"
  href="#footnote900"><sup>[900]</sup></a>Marsham; who cannot extricate
  himself from the difficulties with which his system is attended. He has
  taken for granted, that Sesostris and Sesonchosis are the Sesac of the
  Scriptures; though every circumstance of their history is repugnant to
  that notion. <a name="footnotetag901"
  href="#footnote901"><sup>[901]</sup></a><i>I know</i> <i>not,</i> says
  he, <i>what to make of this Sesonchosis; who is represented as five
  thousand years before Menes, and who is referred to the time of the
  Demigods</i>. In another place: <i>Sesostris, who is in the twelfth
  Dynasty of Africanus, and whose æra extends higher, than the Canon of
  Eusebius reaches, reigned according to Scaliger's computation in the
  1392d year of the Julian Period. By this calculation Sesostris is made
  prior to Sesostris; and this too by no less than 2355 years: for it is
  manifest, as I will shew from Scripture, that Sesostris undertook his
  expedition into Asia, and got possession of Jerusalem in the 3747th year
  of the Period abovementioned</i>. What is said in the sacred writings, I
  have taken notice of before. Not a word occurs about Sesostris, nor of
  any such Asiatic expedition. I am obliged to say, that through the whole
  of this learned writer's process, instead of a proof, we find nothing
  else but the question begged, and some inferences of his own in
  consequence of this assumption. He indeed quotes the authority of
  Manethon from Josephus to prove that the great actions of Sesostris were
  the same as were performed by Sesac. But Manethon says no such thing: nor
  does Josephus attribute any such exploits to Sesac: but expressly says
  more than once, that Sesac, and Sesostris were two different <a
  name="footnotetag902" href="#footnote902"><sup>[902]</sup></a>persons. It
  is no where said of Sesac, that he made an expedition into Asia; much
  less that he conquered it, as is supposed of Sesostris. Sesac went up
  against Jerusalem, and took it, <span title="amachêti" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;</span>, without
  meeting with any opposition. Upon this he departed, and carried with him
  the treasures which he had there seized: in other words, he went home
  again. There is not the least mention made of his invading <a
  name="footnotetag903" href="#footnote903"><sup>[903]</sup></a>Samaria, or
  the country about Libanus, and Sidon; or of his marching to Syria: all
  which made but a small part of the great Continent, called in aftertimes
  Asia: much less did he visit the countries of the Assyrians, and
  Babylonians; or the regions of Elam and the Medes. All this, and much
  more he must have done, to have come up to the character, to which they
  would fain entitle him.</p>

  <p>I will not enter into any farther discussion of the great conquests
  attributed to this supposed monarch Sesostris. They are as ideal as those
  of Sesac, and sufficiently confute themselves. First Osiris is said to
  have conquered the whole earth: then Zeus, then Perseus, then <a
  name="footnotetag904" href="#footnote904"><sup>[904]</sup></a>Hercules,
  all nearly of the same degree of antiquity, if we may believe the best
  Mythologists. Myrina comes in for a share of conquest in the time of
  Orus. After her Thoules subdues the whole from the Eastern Ocean, to the
  great Atlantic: and as if nothing had been performed before, Sesostris
  immediately succeeds, and conquers it over again. <a
  name="footnotetag905" href="#footnote905"><sup>[905]</sup></a>Herodotus
  informs us, as a token of these victories, that Sesostris erected pillars
  and obelisks with emblematical inscriptions: and that he saw some of them
  in Phrygia, and in other countries, which had been conquered. He without
  doubt saw pillars: but how did he know for certain, by whom they were
  erected? and who taught him to interpret the symbols? Pausanias takes <a
  name="footnotetag906" href="#footnote906"><sup>[906]</sup></a>notice of a
  colossal statue in the Thebäis, and says that the history given of it was
  not satisfactory. He tells us, that it stood near the Syringes, in upper
  Egypt; and he viewed it with great admiration. It was the figure of a man
  in a sitting posture; which some said was the representation of Memnon
  the Ethiopian: others maintained, that it was the statue of Phamenophis:
  and others again, that it related to Sesostris. There were here emblems,
  and symbols; yet a diversity of opinions. I want therefore to know, how
  Herodotus could interpret in Phrygia, what a native could not decypher in
  Egypt. The same question may be asked about the people of Syria, among
  whom were obelisks attributed to the same person. How came they to be so
  determinate about an Egyptian work; when people of that country in the
  same circumstances were so utterly at a loss? the whole undoubtedly was
  matter of surmise. I shall not therefore say any thing more of Sesostris;
  as I must again speak of him, when I come to the kings of Egypt.</p>

  <p>If we compare the above histories, we may perceive that they bear a
  manifest similitude to one another; though they are attributed to
  different persons. They contain accounts of great achievements in the
  first ages: in effecting which these antient heroes are represented as
  traversing immense regions, and carrying their arms to the very limits of
  the known world: the great Tartarian ocean to the east, and the Atlantic
  westward, being the boundaries of their travel. Some of them seem to have
  been of the same age; and to have carried on these conquests at nearly
  the same time: and those, whose æra may possibly differ, have this in
  common with the others; that they visit the same countries, march for the
  most part by the same rout; and are often joined by the same allies, and
  are followed by the like attendants. They are in general esteemed
  benefactors, wherever they go: and carry the sciences with them, as well
  as their religious rites; in which they instruct the natives in different
  parts of the world. These are to be sure noble occurrences; which however
  could not possibly have happened, as they are represented above. It is
  not to be supposed, that any person in those early ages, or in any age,
  could go over such a tract of country; much less that he should subdue
  it. It is still more improbable, that such extensive conquests should be
  so immediately repeated: and that they should in some instances be
  carried on by different people at nearly the same time. They, who speak
  of mighty empires being founded in those early days, know little of true
  history; and have formed a very wrong judgment of the politics, which
  then universally prevailed. The whole earth, as far as we can learn, was
  divided into little coördinate states: every city seems to have been
  subservient to its own Judge and Ruler, and independent of all others. In
  the land of <a name="footnotetag907"
  href="#footnote907"><sup>[907]</sup></a>Canaan thirty-one kings were
  subdued by Joshua, between Jordan and the sea: and some were still left
  by him unconquered. In those days, says the learned Marsham, quot urbes,
  tot regna. The like was for many ages after observable in Greece, as well
  as in Latham, Samnium, and Hetruria. A powerful enemy made Egypt unite
  under one head: and the necessities of the people in a time of dearth
  served to complete that system. The Israelites too, when settled in
  Canaan, formed a large kingdom. Excepting these two nations we know of
  none of any considerable extent, that were thus united. The <a
  name="footnotetag908" href="#footnote908"><sup>[908]</sup></a>Syrians and
  the Philistim were in separate states, and under different governors. The
  kingdoms of Nineve and Babylonia consisted each of one mighty city, with
  its environs; in which were perhaps included some subordinate villages.
  They were properly walled <a name="footnotetag909"
  href="#footnote909"><sup>[909]</sup></a>Provinces; and the inhabitants
  were in a state of rest for ages. The Assyrian did not till about seven
  hundred years before Christ, begin to contend for dominion, and make
  acquisition of territory: and we may form a judgment, from what he then
  <a name="footnotetag910" href="#footnote910"><sup>[910]</sup></a>gained,
  of what he was possessed before. The cities Hala, Habor, Haran in
  Mesopotamia, with Carchemish upon the Euphrates, were his first
  conquests: to these he added the puny states Ina, Iva, and Sepharvaim
  upon the same river. He then proceeded to Hamath, Damascus, and other
  cities of Syria; and at last came to Samaria. The line of conquest points
  out the route, which he took; and shews that there were in Mesopotamia
  numberless little states, independent of Babylon and Nineve, though in
  their immediate vicinity. Consequently the notion of the extent,
  dominion, and antiquity of those Monarchies, as delivered by Ctesias and
  others, is entirely void of truth. The conquests likewise of those Heroes
  and Demigods, who are made coeval with the supposed foundations of those
  Monarchies, must be equally groundless. To say the truth, the very
  personages are ideal, and have been formed out of the titles of the
  Deity: and the history, with which they are attended, related not to
  conquest, but to peregrinations of another nature; to Colonies which went
  abroad, and settled in the countries mentioned. The antients, as I have
  repeatedly said, have given to a person, what related to a people: and if
  we make this small allowance, the history will be found in great measure
  true.</p>

<h3>NINUS <font class="sc">and</font> SEMIRAMIS.</h3>

  <p>Having given an account of the mythic heroes of Egypt, I think it
  necessary to subjoin an history of two others of the like stamp, who have
  made no less figure in the annals of Babylon and Assyria. The persons, to
  whom I allude, are Ninus and Semiramis; whose conquests, though they did
  not extend so far as those above, are yet alike wonderful, and equally
  groundless. It is said of Ninus, that he was the first king of <a
  name="footnotetag911" href="#footnote911"><sup>[911]</sup></a>Assyria:
  and being a prince of great power, he made war on his neighbours the
  Babylonians, whom he conquered. He afterwards invaded the Armenians;
  whose king Barsanes, finding himself much inferior to his adversary,
  diverted his anger by great presents, and a voluntary <a
  name="footnotetag912" href="#footnote912"><sup>[912]</sup></a>submission.
  The next object of his ambition was Media, which he soon subdued; and
  getting Phanius, the king of the country, into his hands, together with
  his wife and seven children, he condemned them all to be <ins
  class="correction" title="comma in original">crucified.</ins> His hopes
  being greatly raised by this success, he proceeded to reduce all the
  nations to his obedience between the Tanaïs and the Nile: and in
  seventeen years he made so great a progress, that, excepting Bactria, all
  Asia submitted to him as far as the river Indus. In the series of
  conquered countries Ctesias enumerates Egypt, Phenicia, Coile Syria,
  Cilicia, Pamphylia, Lycia, Caria, Phrygia, Mysia, Lydia, Cappadocia, and
  the nations in Pontus, and those near the Tanaïs. To these are added the
  Dacians, Hyrcanians, Derbicians, Carmanians, Parthians, with all Persis
  and Susiana, and the numerous nations upon the Caspian sea. After these
  notable actions he laid the foundation of the great city Nineve: which by
  mistake is said to have been built upon the banks of the <a
  name="footnotetag913" href="#footnote913"><sup>[913]</sup></a>Euphrates.
  His last expedition was against the Bactrians: at which time he first saw
  Semiramis, a woman of uncommon endowments, and great personal charms. He
  had an army which amounted to seven millions of foot, and two millions of
  horse, with two hundred thousand chariots with scythes. For the
  possibility of which circumstances Diodorus tries to account in favour of
  the historian, from whom he borrows. By the conduct of Semiramis the
  Bactrians are subdued; and Ninus takes the capital of the country: upon
  which, in return for her services, he makes Semiramis his queen. Not long
  after he dies, leaving only one son by this princess, who was called
  Ninyas.</p>

  <p>The history of Semiramis is variously related by different authors.
  Some make her a native of Ascalon; and say that she was exposed in the
  desert, and nourished by pigeons. She was in this situation discovered by
  a shepherd named Simma. He bred her up, and married her to Menon; whom
  she deserted for Ninus. During her son's minority she assumed the regal
  state: and the first work which she undertook was the interment of her
  husband. She accordingly buried him with great splendor; and raised over
  him a mound of earth, no less than a mile and a quarter high, and
  proportionally wide at bottom: after which she built Babylon. This being
  finished, she made an expedition into Media; and wherever she came left
  memorials of her power and munificence. This was effected by erecting
  vast structures, forming lakes, and laying out gardens of great extent;
  particularly in Chaonia and Ecbatana. In short, she levelled hills, and
  raised <a name="footnotetag914"
  href="#footnote914"><sup>[914]</sup></a>mounds of an immense height,
  which retained her name for ages. After this she invaded Egypt, and
  conquered Ethiopia, with the greater part of Lybia: and having
  accomplished her wish, and there being no enemy to cope with her,
  excepting the people of India, she resolved to direct her forces towards
  that quarter. She had an army of three millions of foot, five hundred
  thousand horse, and one hundred thousand chariots. For the passing of
  rivers, and engaging with the enemy by water, she had procured two
  thousand ships, to be so constructed as to be taken to pieces for the
  advantage of carriage: which ships were built in Bactria by experienced
  persons from Phenicia, Syria, and Cyprus. With these she entered into a
  naval engagement with Strabrobates king of India; and at the first
  encounter sunk a thousand of his ships. Upon this she built a bridge over
  the river Indus, and penetrated into the heart of the country. Here
  Strabrobates engaged her; but being deceived by the numerous appearance
  of her elephants, at first gave way. For being deficient in those
  animals, she had procured the hides of three thousand black oxen; which
  being properly sewed, and stuffed with straw, formed an appearance of so
  many elephants. All this was done so naturally, that the real animals
  could not stand the sight. But this stratagem being at last discovered,
  Semiramis was obliged to retreat, after having lost a great part of her
  <a name="footnotetag915" href="#footnote915"><sup>[915]</sup></a>army.
  Soon after this she resigned the government to her son Ninyas, and died.
  According to some writers, she was slain by his hand.</p>

  <p>The history of Ninus and Semiramis, as here represented, is in great
  measure founded upon terms, which have been misconstrued; and these
  fictions have been invented in consequence of the mistakes. Under the
  character of Semiramis we are certainly to understand a people styled
  Semarim, a <ins class="correction" title="'titled' in original"
  >title</ins> assumed by the antient Babylonians. They were called Semarim
  from their insigne, which was a dove, expressed Semaramas, of which I
  shall speak hereafter more at large. It was used as an object of worship;
  and esteemed the same as Rhea, the mother of the gods: <a
  name="footnotetag916" href="#footnote916"><sup>[916]</sup></a><span
  title="Semiramin kai tên Rhean kaloumenên par' Assuriois." class="grk"

  &#x391;&#x3C3;&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;.</span></p>

  <p>If we take the history of Semiramis, as it is given us by Ctesias and
  others; nothing can be more inconsistent. Some make her the wife of
  Ninus: others say that she was his <a name="footnotetag917"
  href="#footnote917"><sup>[917]</sup></a>daughter: and about the time of
  her birth they vary beyond measure. She is sometimes made cöeval with the
  city Nineve: at other times she is brought down within a few centuries of
  <a name="footnotetag918"
  href="#footnote918"><sup>[918]</sup></a>Herodotus. She invades the
  Babylonians before the city was <a name="footnotetag919"
  href="#footnote919"><sup>[919]</sup></a>built, from whence they were
  denominated: and makes sumptuous gardens at Ecbatana. Hence that city is
  introduced as coëval with Nineve: though, if the least credit may be
  given to <a name="footnotetag920"
  href="#footnote920"><sup>[920]</sup></a>Herodotus, it was built many ages
  after by Deïoces the Mede. The city Nineve itself is by Ctesias placed
  upon the <a name="footnotetag921"
  href="#footnote921"><sup>[921]</sup></a>Euphrates; though every other
  writer agrees, that it lay far to the east, and was situated upon the
  Tigris. This shews how little credit is to be paid to Ctesias. The whole
  account of the fleet of ships built in Bactria, and carried upon camels
  to the Indus, is a childish forgery. How can we suppose, that there were
  no woods to construct such vessels, but in the most inland regions of
  Asia? The story of the fictitious elephants, made out of the hides of
  black oxen, which put to flight the real elephants, is another silly
  fable. Megasthenes, who wrote of India, would not allow that Semiramis
  was ever in those <a name="footnotetag922"
  href="#footnote922"><sup>[922]</sup></a>parts. Arrian seems to speak of
  it as a groundless <a name="footnotetag923"
  href="#footnote923"><sup>[923]</sup></a>surmise. Her building of Babylon
  was by <a name="footnotetag924"
  href="#footnote924"><sup>[924]</sup></a>Berosus treated as a fable.
  Herennius Philo maintained, that it was built by a son of Belus the wise,
  two thousand years before her <a name="footnotetag925"
  href="#footnote925"><sup>[925]</sup></a>birth. Suidas says, that she
  called Nineve <a name="footnotetag926"
  href="#footnote926"><sup>[926]</sup></a>Babylon: so uncertain is every
  circumstance about this Heroine. She is supposed to have sent to Cyprus,
  and Phenicia, for artists to construct and manage the ships
  abovementioned; as if there had been people in those parts famous for
  navigation before the foundation of Nineve. They sometimes give to
  Semiramis herself the merit of building the <a name="footnotetag927"
  href="#footnote927"><sup>[927]</sup></a>first ship; and likewise the
  invention of weaving cotton: and another invention more extraordinary,
  which was that of emasculating <a name="footnotetag928"
  href="#footnote928"><sup>[928]</sup></a>men, that they might be
  guardians, and overseers in her service. Yet, it is said of her, that she
  took a man to her bed every night, whom she put to death in the morning.
  How can it be imagined, if she was a woman of such unbridled <a
  name="footnotetag929" href="#footnote929"><sup>[929]</sup></a>lust, that
  she would admit such spies upon her actions? We may as well suppose, that
  a felon would forge his own gyves, and construct his own prison. Claudian
  thinks, that she did it to conceal her own sex, by having a set of
  beardless people about her.</p>

  <p>In respect to Semiramis I do not see how this expedient could avail.
  She might just as well have dressed up her maids in mens clothes, and
  with less trouble. In short the whole of these histories in their common
  acceptation is to the last degree absurd, and improbable: but if we make
  use of an expedient, which I have often recommended, and for a person
  substitute a people, we shall find, when it is stripped of its false
  colouring, that there is much truth in the narration.</p>

  <p>It was a common mode of expression to call a tribe or family by the
  name of its founder: and a nation by the head of the line. People are
  often spoken of collectively in the singular under such a patronymic.
  Hence we read in Scripture, that Israel abode in tents; that Judah was
  put to the worst in battle; that Dan abode in ships; and Asher remained
  on the sea-coast. The same manner of speaking undoubtedly prevailed both
  in Egypt, and in other countries: and Chus must have been often put for
  the Cuthites, or Cuseans; Amon for the Amonians; and Asur, or the
  Assyrian, for the people of Assyria. Hence, when it was said, that the
  Ninevite performed any great action, it has been ascribed to a person
  Ninus, the supposed founder of Nineve. And as none of the Assyrian
  conquests were antecedent to Pul, and Assur Adon, writers have been
  guilty of an unpardonable anticipation, in ascribing those conquests to
  the first king of the country. A like anticipation, amounting to a great
  many centuries, is to be found in the annals of the Babylonians. Every
  thing that was done in later times, has been attributed to Belus,
  Semiramis, and other, imaginary princes, who are represented as the
  founders of the kingdom. We may, I think, be assured, that under the
  character of Ninus, and Ninyas, we are to understand the Ninevites; as by
  Semiramis is meant a people called Samarim: and the great actions of
  these two nations are in the histories of these personages recorded. But
  writers have rendered the account inconsistent by limiting, what was an
  historical series of many ages, to the life of a single person. The
  Ninevites and Samarim did perform all that is attributed to Semiramis,
  and Ninus. They did conquer the Medes, and Bactrians; and extended their
  dominions westward as far as Phrygia, and the river Tanais, and to the
  Southward as far as Arabia, and Egypt. But these events were many ages
  after the foundation of the two kingdoms. They began under Pul of Nineve;
  and were carried on by Assur Adon, Salmanassur, Sennacherib, and other of
  his successors. Nineve was at last ruined, and the kingdom of Assyria was
  united with that of <a name="footnotetag931"
  href="#footnote931"><sup>[931]</sup></a>Babylonia. This is probably
  alluded to in the supposed marriage of Semiramis and Ninus. Then it was,
  that the Samarim performed the great works attributed to them. For,
  exclusive of what was performed at Babylon; <i>There are</i>, says <a
  name="footnotetag932" href="#footnote932"><sup>[932]</sup></a>Strabo,
  <i>almost over the face of the whole earth, vast <a name="footnotetag933"
  href="#footnote933"><sup>[933]</sup></a>mounds of earth, and walls, and
  ramparts, attributed to Semiramis; and in these are subterraneous
  passages of communication, and tanks for water, with staircases of stone.
  There are also vast canals to divert the course of rivers, and lakes to
  receive them; together with highways and bridges of a wonderful
  structure</i>. They built the famous terraces at <a name="footnotetag934"
  href="#footnote934"><sup>[934]</sup></a>Babylon; and those beautiful
  gardens at Egbatana, after that city had fallen into their hands. To them
  was owing that cruel device of emasculating their slaves, that their
  numerous wives, and concubines might be more securely guarded: an
  invention, which cannot consistently be attributed to a woman. They found
  out the art of weaving cotton: which discovery has by some been assigned
  to those of their family, who went into Egypt: for there were Samarim
  here too. In consequence of this, the invention has been attributed to a
  Semiramis, who is here represented as a man, and a king of the country:
  at least it is referred to his reign. <a name="footnotetag935"

  The Samarim of Egypt and Babylonia, were of the same family, the sons of
  Chus. They came and settled among the Mizraim, under the name of the
  shepherds, of whose history I have often spoken. The reason of their
  being called Semarim, and Samarim, I shall hereafter disclose, together
  with the purport of the name, and the history, with which it is
  attended.</p>

<h3>ZOROASTER.</h3>

  <p>The celebrated Zoroaster seems to have been a personage as much
  mistaken, as any, who have preceded. The antients, who treated of him,
  have described him in the same foreign light, as they have represented
  Perseus, Dionusus, and Osiris. They have formed a character, which by
  length of time has been separated, and estranged, from the person, to
  whom it originally belonged. And as among the antients, there was not a
  proper uniformity observed in the appropriation of terms, we shall find
  more persons than one spoken of under the character of Zoroaster: though
  there was one principal, to whom it more truly related. It will be found,
  that not only the person originally recorded, and reverenced; but others,
  by whom the rites were instituted and propagated, and by whom they were
  in aftertimes renewed, have been mentioned under this title: Priests
  being often denominated from the Deity, whom they served.</p>

  <p>Of men, styled Zoroaster, the first was a deified personage,
  reverenced by some of his posterity, whose worship was styled Magia, and
  the professors of it Magi. His history is therefore to be looked for
  among the accounts transmitted by the antient Babylonians, and Chaldeans.
  They were the first people styled Magi; and the institutors of those
  rites, which related to Zoroaster. From them this worship was imparted to
  the Persians, who likewise had their Magi. And when the Babylonians sunk
  into a more complicated idolatry, the Persians, who succeeded to the
  sovereignty of Asia, renewed under their Princes, and particularly under
  Darius, the son of Hystaspes, these rites, which had been, in a great
  degree, effaced, and forgotten. That king was devoted to the religion
  styled Magia<a name="footnotetag936"
  href="#footnote936"><sup>[936]</sup></a>; and looked upon it as one of
  his most honourable titles, to be called a professor of those doctrines.
  The Persians were originally named Peresians, from the Deity Perez, or
  Parez the Sun; whom they also worshipped under the title of <a
  name="footnotetag937" href="#footnote937"><sup>[937]</sup></a>Zor-Aster.
  They were at different æras greatly distressed and persecuted, especially
  upon the death of their last king Yesdegerd. Upon this account they
  retired into Gedrosia and India; where people of the same family had for
  ages resided. They carried with them some shattered memorials of their
  religion in writing, from whence the Sadder, Shaster, Vedam, and
  Zandavasta were compiled. These memorials seem to have been taken from
  antient symbols ill understood; and all that remains of them consists of
  extravagant allegories and fables, of which but little now can be
  decyphered. Upon these traditions the religion of the Brahmins and
  Persees is founded.</p>

  <p>The person who is supposed to have first formed a code of institutes
  for this people, is said to have been one of the Magi, named Zerdusht. I
  mention this, because Hyde, and other learned men, have imagined this
  Zerdusht to have been the antient Zoroaster. They have gone so far as to
  suppose the two names to have been the <a name="footnotetag938"
  href="#footnote938"><sup>[938]</sup></a>same; between which I can scarce
  descry any resemblance. There seem to have been many persons styled
  Zoroaster: so that if the name had casually retained any affinity, or if
  it had been literally the same, yet it would not follow, that this Persic
  and Indian Theologist was the person of whom antiquity speaks so loudly.
  We read of persons of this name in different parts of the world, who were
  all of them Magi, or Priests, and denominated from the rites of
  Zoroaster, which they followed. Suidas mentions a Zoroaster, whom he
  styles an Assyrian; and another whom he calls <span title="Perso-Mêdês" class="grk"
  >&#x3A0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;-&#x39C;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Perso-Medes: and describes them both as great in science. There was a
  Zoroaster Proconnesius, in the time of Xerxes, spoken of by <a
  name="footnotetag939" href="#footnote939"><sup>[939]</sup></a>Pliny.
  Arnobius mentions Zoroastres Bactrianus: and Zoroastres Zostriani nepos
  <a name="footnotetag940"
  href="#footnote940"><sup>[940]</sup></a>Armenius. Clemens Alexandrinus
  takes notice of Zoroaster <a name="footnotetag941"
  href="#footnote941"><sup>[941]</sup></a>Medus, who is probably the same
  as the Perso-Medes of Suidas. Zoroastres Armenius is likewise mentioned
  by him, but is styled the son of <a name="footnotetag942"
  href="#footnote942"><sup>[942]</sup></a>Armenius, and a Pamphylian. It is
  said of him that he had a renewal of life: and that during the term that
  he was in a state of death, he learned many things of the Gods. This was
  a piece of mythology, which I imagine did not relate to the Pamphylian
  Magus, but to the head of all the Magi, who was reverenced and worshipped
  by them. There was another styled a Persian, whom Pythagoras is said to
  have <a name="footnotetag943"
  href="#footnote943"><sup>[943]</sup></a>visited. Justin takes notice of
  the Bactrian <a name="footnotetag944"
  href="#footnote944"><sup>[944]</sup></a>Zoroaster, whom he places in the
  time of Ninus. He is also mentioned by <a name="footnotetag945"
  href="#footnote945"><sup>[945]</sup></a>Cephalion, who speaks of his
  birth, and the birth of Semiramis (<span title="genesin Semirameôs kai Zôroastrou Magou" class="grk"
  >&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;

  &#x39C;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span>) as of the same date. The
  natives of India have a notion of a Zoroaster, who was of Chinese
  original, as we are informed by <a name="footnotetag946"
  href="#footnote946"><sup>[946]</sup></a>Hyde. This learned man supposes
  all these personages, the Mede, the Medo-Persic, the Proconnesian, the
  Bactrian, the Pamphylian, &amp;c. to have been one and the same. This is
  very wonderful; as they are by their history apparently different. He
  moreover adds, that however people may differ about the origin of this
  person, yet all are unanimous about the time when he <a
  name="footnotetag947" href="#footnote947"><sup>[947]</sup></a>lived. To
  see that these could not all be the same person, we need only to cast our
  eye back upon the evidence which has been collected above: and it will be
  equally certain, that they could not be all of the same æra. There are
  many specified in history; but we may perceive, that there was one person
  more antient and celebrated than the rest; whose history has been
  confounded with that of others who came after him. This is a circumstance
  which has been observed by <a name="footnotetag948"
  href="#footnote948"><sup>[948]</sup></a>many: but this ingenious writer
  unfortunately opposes all who have written upon the subject, however
  determinately they may have expressed themselves. <a
  name="footnotetag949" href="#footnote949"><sup>[949]</sup></a>At quicquid
  dixerint, ille (Zoroaster) fuit tantum unus, isque tempore Darii
  Hystaspis: nec ejus nomine plures unquam extitere. It is to be observed,
  that the person, whom he styles Zoroaster, was one Zerdusht. He lived, it
  seems, in the reign of Darius, the father of Xerxes; which was about the
  time of the battle of Marathon: consequently not a century before the
  birth of Eudoxus, Xenophon, and Plato. We have therefore no authority to
  suppose <a name="footnotetag950"
  href="#footnote950"><sup>[950]</sup></a>this Zerdusht to have been the
  famous Zoroaster. He was apparently the renewer of the Sabian rites: and
  we may be assured, that he could not be the person so celebrated by the
  antients, who was referred to the first ages. Hyde asserts, that all
  writers agree about the time, when Zoroaster made his appearance: and he
  places him, as we have seen above, in the reign of Darius. But Xanthus
  Lydius made him above <a name="footnotetag951"
  href="#footnote951"><sup>[951]</sup></a>six hundred years prior. And <a
  name="footnotetag952" href="#footnote952"><sup>[952]</sup></a>Suidas from
  some anonymous author places him five hundred years before the war of
  Troy. Hermodorus Platonicus went much farther, and made him five thousand
  years before that <a name="footnotetag953"
  href="#footnote953"><sup>[953]</sup></a>æra. Hermippus, who professedly
  wrote of his doctrines, supposed him to have been of the same <a
  name="footnotetag954" href="#footnote954"><sup>[954]</sup></a>antiquity.
  Plutarch also <a name="footnotetag955"
  href="#footnote955"><sup>[955]</sup></a>concurs, and allows him five
  thousand years before that war. Eudoxus, who was a consummate
  philosopher, and a great traveller, supposed him to have flourished six
  thousand years before the death of <a name="footnotetag956"
  href="#footnote956"><sup>[956]</sup></a>Plato. Moses <a
  name="footnotetag957"
  href="#footnote957"><sup>[957]</sup></a>Chorenensis, and <a
  name="footnotetag958" href="#footnote958"><sup>[958]</sup></a>Cephalion,
  make him only contemporary with Ninus, and Semiramis: but even this
  removes him very far from the reign of Darius. Pliny goes beyond them
  all; and places him many thousand years before Moses. <a
  name="footnotetag959" href="#footnote959"><sup>[959]</sup></a>Est et alia
  Magices factio, a Mose, et Jamne, et Lotapea Judæis pendens: sed multis
  millibus annorum post Zoroastrem. The numbers in all these authors, are
  extravagant: but so much we may learn from them, that they relate to a
  person of the highest antiquity. And the purport of the original writers,
  from whence the Grecians borrowed their evidence, was undoubtedly to
  shew, that the person spoken of lived at the extent of time; at the
  commencement of all historical data. No fact, no memorial upon record, is
  placed so high as they have carried this personage. Had Zoroaster been no
  earlier than Darius, Eudoxus would never have advanced him to this degree
  of antiquity. This writer was at the same distance from Darius, as Plato,
  of whom he speaks: and it is not to be believed, that he could be so
  ignorant, as not to distinguish between a century, and six thousand
  years. Agathias indeed mentions, that some of the Persians had a notion,
  that he flourished in the time of one Hystaspes; but he confesses, that
  who the Hystaspes was, and at what time he lived, was <a
  name="footnotetag960" href="#footnote960"><sup>[960]</sup></a>uncertain.
  Aristotle wrote not long after Eudoxus, when the history of the Persians
  was more known to the Grecians, and he allots the same number of years
  between Zoroaster and Plato, as had been <a name="footnotetag961"
  href="#footnote961"><sup>[961]</sup></a>before given. These accounts are
  for the most part carried too far; but at the same time, they fully
  ascertain the high antiquity of this person, whose æra is in question. It
  is plain that these writers in general extend the time of his life to the
  æra of the world, according to their estimation; and make it prior to
  Inachus, and Phoroneus, and Ægialeus of Sicyon.</p>

  <p>Huetius takes notice of the various accounts in respect to his
  country. <a name="footnotetag962"
  href="#footnote962"><sup>[962]</sup></a>Zoroastrem nunc Persam, nunc
  Medum ponit Clemens Alexandrinus; Persomedum Suidas; plerique
  Bactrianuni; alii Æthiopem, quos inter ait Arnobius ex Æthiopiâ interiore
  per igneam Zonam venisse Zoroastrem. In short, they have supposed a
  Zoroaster, wherever there was a Zoroastrian: that is, wherever the
  religion of the Magi was adopted, or revived. Many were called after him:
  but who among men was the Prototype can only be found out by diligently
  collating the histories, which have been transmitted. I mention <i>among
  men</i>; for the title originally belonged to the Sun; but was
  metaphorically bestowed upon sacred and enlightened personages. Some have
  thought that the person alluded to was Ham. He has by others been taken
  for Chus, also for Mizraim, and <a name="footnotetag963"
  href="#footnote963"><sup>[963]</sup></a>Nimrod: and by Huetius for Moses.
  It may be worth while to consider the primitive character, as given by
  different writers. He was esteemed the first observer of the heavens; and
  it is said that the antient Babylonians received their knowledge in
  Astronomy from him: which was afterwards revived under Ostanes; and from
  them it was derived to the <a name="footnotetag964"
  href="#footnote964"><sup>[964]</sup></a>Egyptians, and to the Greeks.
  Zoroaster was looked upon as the head of all those, who are supposed to
  have followed his <a name="footnotetag965"
  href="#footnote965"><sup>[965]</sup></a>institutes: consequently he must
  have been prior to the Magi, and Magia, the priests, and worship, which
  were derived from him. Of what antiquity they were, may be learned from
  Aristotle. <a name="footnotetag966"

  <i>The Magi, according to Aristotle, were prior even to the
  Egyptians</i>: and with the antiquity of the Egyptians, we are well
  acquainted. Plato styles him the son of <a name="footnotetag967"
  href="#footnote967"><sup>[967]</sup></a>Oromazes, who was the chief Deity
  of the Persians: and it is said of him, that he laughed upon the day on
  which he was <a name="footnotetag968"
  href="#footnote968"><sup>[968]</sup></a>born. By this I imagine, that
  something fortunate was supposed to be portended: some indication, that
  the child would prove a blessing to the world. In his childhood he is
  said to have been under the care of <a name="footnotetag969"
  href="#footnote969"><sup>[969]</sup></a>Azonaces: which I should imagine
  was a name of the chief Deity Oromazes, his reputed father. He was in
  process of time greatly enriched with knowledge, and became in high
  repute for his <a name="footnotetag970"
  href="#footnote970"><sup>[970]</sup></a>piety, and justice. He first
  sacrificed to the Gods, and taught men to do the <a name="footnotetag971"
  href="#footnote971"><sup>[971]</sup></a>same. He likewise instructed them
  in science, for which he was greatly <a name="footnotetag972"
  href="#footnote972"><sup>[972]</sup></a>famed: and was the first who gave
  them laws. The Babylonians seem to have referred to him every thing,
  which by the Egyptians was attributed to Thoth and Hermes. He had the
  title of <a name="footnotetag973"
  href="#footnote973"><sup>[973]</sup></a>Zarades, which signifies the Lord
  of light, and is equivalent to Orus, Oromanes, and Osiris, It was
  sometimes expressed <a name="footnotetag974"
  href="#footnote974"><sup>[974]</sup></a>Zar-Atis, and supposed to belong
  to a feminine Deity of the Persians. Moses Chorenensis styles him <a
  name="footnotetag975" href="#footnote975"><sup>[975]</sup></a>Zarovanus,
  and speaks of him as the father of the Gods. Plutarch would insinuate,
  that he was author of the doctrine, embraced afterwards by the
  Manicheans, concerning two prevailing principles, the one good, and the
  other evil<a name="footnotetag976"
  href="#footnote976"><sup>[976]</sup></a>: the former of these was named
  Oromazes, the latter Areimanius. But these notions were of late <a
  name="footnotetag977" href="#footnote977"><sup>[977]</sup></a>date, in
  comparison of the antiquity which is attributed to <a
  name="footnotetag978" href="#footnote978"><sup>[978]</sup></a>Zoroaster.
  If we might credit what was delivered in the writings transmitted under
  his name, which were probably composed by some of the later Magi, they
  would afford us a much higher notion of his doctrines. Or if the account
  given by Ostanes were genuine, it would prove, that there had been a true
  notion of the Deity transmitted from <a name="footnotetag979"
  href="#footnote979"><sup>[979]</sup></a>Zoroaster, and kept up by the
  Magi, when the rest of the gentile world was in darkness. But this was by
  no means true. It is said of Zoroaster, that he had a renewal of <a
  name="footnotetag980" href="#footnote980"><sup>[980]</sup></a>life: for I
  apply to the original person of the name, what was attributed to the
  Magus of Pamphylia: and it is related of him, that while he was in the
  intermediate state of death, he was instructed by the <a
  name="footnotetag981" href="#footnote981"><sup>[981]</sup></a>Gods. Some
  speak of his retiring to a mountain of Armenia, where he had an
  intercourse with the <a name="footnotetag982"
  href="#footnote982"><sup>[982]</sup></a>Deity: and when the mountain
  burned with fire, he was preserved unhurt. The place to which he retired,
  according to the Persic writers, was in the region called <a
  name="footnotetag983" href="#footnote983"><sup>[983]</sup></a>Adarbain;
  where in aftertimes was the greatest Puratheion in Asia. This region was
  in Armenia: and some make him to have been born in the same country, upon
  one of the Gordiæan <a name="footnotetag984"
  href="#footnote984"><sup>[984]</sup></a>mountains. Here it was, that he
  first instituted sacrifices, and gave laws to his followers; which laws
  are supposed to be contained in the sacred book named Zandavasta. To him
  has been attributed the invention of Magic; which notion has arisen from
  a misapplication of terms. The Magi Were priests, and they called
  religion in general Magia. They, and their rites, grew into disrepute; in
  consequence of which they were by the Greeks called <span

  href="#footnote987"><sup>[987]</sup></a>Dion. Chrysostom, and Porphyry
  speak to the same purpose. By Zoroaster being the author of Magia, is
  meant, that he was the first promoter of religious rites, and the
  instructor of men in their duty to God. The war of Ninus with Zoroaster
  of Bactria relates probably to some hostilities carried on between the
  Ninevites of Assyria, and the Bactrians, who had embraced the Zoroastrian
  rites. Their priest, or prince, for they were of old the same, was named
  <a name="footnotetag988"
  href="#footnote988"><sup>[988]</sup></a>Oxuartes; but from his office had
  the title of Zoroaster; which was properly the name of the Sun, whom he
  adored. This religion began in Chaldea; and it is expressly said of this
  Bactrian king, that he borrowed the knowledge of it from that country,
  and added to it largely. <a name="footnotetag989"
  href="#footnote989"><sup>[989]</sup></a>Cujus scientiæ sæculis priscis
  multa ex Chaldæorum arcanis Bactrianus addidit Zoroastres. When the
  Persians gained the empire in Asia, they renewed these rites, and
  doctrines. <a name="footnotetag990"
  href="#footnote990"><sup>[990]</sup></a>Multa deinde (addidit) Hystaspes
  Rex prudentissimus, Darii pater. These rites were idolatrous; yet not so
  totally depraved, and gross, as those of other nations. They were
  introduced by Chus; at least by the Cuthites: one branch of whom were the
  Peresians, or Persians. The Cuthites of Chaldea were the original Magi,
  and they gave to Chus the title of Zoroaster Magus, as being the first of
  the order. Hence the account given by Gregorius Turonensis is in a great
  degree true. <a name="footnotetag991"
  href="#footnote991"><sup>[991]</sup></a>Primogeniti Cham filii Noë fuit
  Chus. Hic ad Persas transiit, quem Persæ vocitavere Zoroastrem. Chus, we
  find, was called by this title; and from him the religion styled Magia
  passed to the Persians. But titles, as I have shewn, were not always
  determinately appropriated: nor was Chus the original person, who was
  called Zoroaster. There was another beyond him, who was the first deified
  mortal, and the prototype in this worship. To whom I allude, may, I
  think, be known from the history given above. It will not fail of being
  rendered very clear in the course of my procedure.</p>

  <p>The purport of the term Zoroaster is said, by <a name="footnotetag992"
  href="#footnote992"><sup>[992]</sup></a>the author of the Recognitions,
  and by others, to be <i>the living star</i>: and they speak of it as if
  it were of Grecian etymology, and from the words <span title="zôon" class="grk"
  >&#x3B6;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> and <span title="astêr" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;</span>. It is certainly compounded
  of Aster, which, among many nations, signified a star. But, in respect to
  the former term, as the object of the Persic and Chaldaic worship was the
  Sun, and most of their titles were derived from thence; we may be pretty
  certain, that by Zoro-Aster was meant Sol Asterius. Zor, Sor, Sur, Sehor,
  among the Amonians, always related to the Sun. Eusebius says, that Osiris
  was esteemed the same as Dionusus, and the Sun: and that he was called <a
  name="footnotetag993" href="#footnote993"><sup>[993]</sup></a>Surius. The
  region of Syria was hence denominated <span title="Suria" class="grk"
  >&#x3A3;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>; and is at this day called
  Souria, from Sur, and Sehor, the Sun. The Dea Syria at Hierapolis was
  properly Dea Solaris. In consequence of the Sun's being called Sor, and
  Sur, we find that his temple is often mentioned under the name of <a
  name="footnotetag994" href="#footnote994"><sup>[994]</sup></a>Beth-Sur,
  and <a name="footnotetag995"
  href="#footnote995"><sup>[995]</sup></a>Beth-Sura, which Josephus renders
  <a name="footnotetag996" href="#footnote996"><sup>[996]</sup></a><span
  title="Bêth-Sour" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B7;&#x3B8;-&#x3A3;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C1;</span>. It was also
  called Beth-Sor, and Beth-Soron, as we learn from <a
  name="footnotetag997" href="#footnote997"><sup>[997]</sup></a>Eusebius,
  and <a name="footnotetag998"
  href="#footnote998"><sup>[998]</sup></a>Jerome. That Suria was not merely
  a provincial title is plain, from the Suria Dea being worshipped at Erix
  in <a name="footnotetag999"
  href="#footnote999"><sup>[999]</sup></a>Sicily; and from an inscription
  to her at <a name="footnotetag1000"
  href="#footnote1000"><sup>[1000]</sup></a>Rome. She was worshipped under
  the same title in Britain, as we may infer from an Inscription at Sir
  Robert Cotton's, of Connington, in Cambridgeshire.</p>

  <p>The Grecians therefore were wrong in their etymology; and we may trace
  the origin of their mistake, when they supposed the meaning of Zoroaster
  to have been vivens astrum. I have mentioned, that both Zon and <a
  name="footnotetag1002" href="#footnote1002"><sup>[1002]</sup></a>Zoan
  signified the Sun: and the term Zor had the same meaning. In consequence
  of this, when the Grecians were told that Zor-Aster was the same as
  Zoan-Aster, they, by an uniform mode of mistake, expressed the latter
  <span title="zôon" class="grk">&#x3B6;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>; and
  interpreted Zoroaster <span title="astera zôon" class="grk"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;
  &#x3B6;&#x3C9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. But Zoan signified the Sun. The city
  Zoan in Egypt was Heliopolis; and the land of Zoan the Heliopolitan nome.
  Both Zoan-Aster, and Zor-Aster, signified Sol Asterius. The God Menes was
  worshipped under the symbol of a bull; and oftentimes under the symbol of
  a bull and a man. Hence we read of Meno-Taur, and of Taur-Men, in Crete,
  Sicily, and other places. The same person was also styled simply <a
  name="footnotetag1003" href="#footnote1003"><sup>[1003]</sup></a>Taurus,
  from the emblem under which he was represented. This Taurus was also
  called Aster, and Asterius, as we learn from <a name="footnotetag1004"
  href="#footnote1004"><sup>[1004]</sup></a>Lycophron, and his Scholiast.
  <span title="Ho Astêrios houtos estin ho kai Minotauros" class="grk"

  <i>By Asterius is signified the same person as the Minotaur.</i> This
  Taur-Aster is exactly <ins class="correction" title="'analagous' in original"
  >analogous</ins> to <a name="footnotetag1005"
  href="#footnote1005"><sup>[1005]</sup></a>Zor-Aster above. It was the
  same emblem as the Mneuis, or sacred bull of Egypt; which was described
  with a star between his horns. Upon some of the <a name="footnotetag1006"
  href="#footnote1006"><sup>[1006]</sup></a>entablatures at Naki Rustan,
  supposed to have been the antient Persepolis, we find the Sun to be
  described under the appearance of a bright <a name="footnotetag1007"
  href="#footnote1007"><sup>[1007]</sup></a>star: and nothing can better
  explain the history there represented, than the account given of
  Zoroaster. He was the reputed son of Oromazes, the chief Deity; and his
  principal instructor was Azonaces, the same person under a different
  title. He is spoken of as one greatly beloved by heaven: and it is
  mentioned of him, that he longed very much to see the Deity, which at his
  importunity was granted to him. This interview, however, was not effected
  by his own corporeal eyes, but by the mediation of an <a
  name="footnotetag1008" href="#footnote1008"><sup>[1008]</sup></a>angel.
  Through this medium the vision was performed: and he obtained a view of
  the Deity surrounded with light. The angel, through whose intervention
  this favour was imparted, seems to have been one of those styled Zoni,
  and <a name="footnotetag1009"
  href="#footnote1009"><sup>[1009]</sup></a>Azoni. All the vestments of the
  priests, and those in which they used to apparel their Deities, had
  sacred names, taken from terms in their worship. Such were Camise,
  Candys, Camia, Cidaris, Mitra, Zona, and the like. The last was a sacred
  fillet, or girdle, which they esteemed an emblem of the orbit described
  by Zon, the Sun. They either represented their Gods as girded round with
  a serpent, which was an emblem of the same meaning; or else with this
  bandage, denominated <a name="footnotetag1010"
  href="#footnote1010"><sup>[1010]</sup></a>Zona. They seem to have been
  secondary Deities, who were called Zoni and <a name="footnotetag1011"
  href="#footnote1011"><sup>[1011]</sup></a>Azoni. The term signifies
  Heliadæ: and they were looked upon as æthereal essences, a kind of
  emanation from the Sun. They were exhibited under different
  representations; and oftentimes like Cneph of Egypt. The fillet, with
  which the Azoni were girded, is described as of a fiery nature: and they
  were supposed to have been wafted through the air. Arnobius speaks of it
  in this light. <a name="footnotetag1012"
  href="#footnote1012"><sup>[1012]</sup></a>Age, nunc, veniat, quæso, per
  igneam zonam Magus ab interiore orbe Zoroastres. I imagine, that by

  >&#x391;&#x3B6;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span>,
  beforementioned, the reputed teacher of Zoroaster, was meant the chief
  Deity, the same as Oromanes, and Oromasdes. He seems to have been the
  supreme of those æthereal spirits described above; and to have been named
  Azon-Nakis, which signifies the great Lord, <a name="footnotetag1013"
  href="#footnote1013"><sup>[1013]</sup></a>Azon. Naki, Nakis, Nachis,
  Nachus, Negus, all in different parts of the world betoken a king. The

  this day called the palace of Naki Rustan, whoever that personage may
  have been.</p>

  <p>The character of Orpheus is in some respects not unlike that of
  Zoroaster, as will appear in the sequel. He went over many regions of the
  earth; and in all places, whither he came, was esteemed both as a priest,
  and a prophet. There seems to be more in his history than at first sight
  appears: all which will by degrees be unfolded. His skill in harmony is
  represented as very wonderful: insomuch that he is said to have tamed the
  wild beasts of the forest, and made the trees follow him. He likewise
  could calm the winds, and appease the raging of the sea. These last
  circumstances are taken notice of by a poet in some fine verses, wherein
  he laments his death.</p>

  which is represented as a twofold descent to the shades below. There is

  <p>Some make Orpheus by birth a Thracian; some an Arcadian: others a
  Theban. Pausanias mentions it as an opinion among the <a
  name="footnotetag1025"
  href="#footnote1025"><sup>[1025]</sup></a>Egyptians, that both Orpheus,
  and Amphion, were from their country. There is great uncertainty about
  his parents. He is generally supposed to have been the son of
  &#338;agrus, and Calliope: but Asclepiades made him the son of Apollo, by
  that <a name="footnotetag1026"

  as the son of <a name="footnotetag1028"

  offspring of the Moon, and the Muses</i>: in which account is contained
  some curious mythology. The principal place of his residence is thought
  to have been in Pieria near mount Hæmus. He is also said to have resided
  among the Edonians; and in Sithonia, at the foot of mount Pangæus; also
  upon the sea-coast at Zona. In all these places he displayed his
  superiority in science; for he was not only a Poet, and skilled in
  harmony, but a great Theologist and Prophet; also very knowing in
  medicine, and in the history of the <a name="footnotetag1030"
  href="#footnote1030"><sup>[1030]</sup></a>heavens. According to Antipater
  Sidonius, he was the author of Heroic verse. And some go so far as to
  ascribe to him the invention of letters; and deduce all knowledge from <a
  name="footnotetag1031" href="#footnote1031"><sup>[1031]</sup></a>him.</p>

  <p>Many of the things, reported to have been done by Orpheus, are
  attributed to other persons, such as <a name="footnotetag1032"
  href="#footnote1032"><sup>[1032]</sup></a>Eetion, Musæus, Melampus,
  Linus, Cadmus, and Philammon. Some of these are said to have had the same

  accounts of Orpheus, do not agree about the manner of his <a
  name="footnotetag1034" href="#footnote1034"><sup>[1034]</sup></a>death.
  The common notion is, that he was torn to pieces by the Thracian women.
  But, according to Leonides, in Laërtius, he was slain by lightning: and
  there is an <a name="footnotetag1035"
  href="#footnote1035"><sup>[1035]</sup></a>epitaph to that purpose. The
  name of Orpheus is to be found in the lists of the Argonauts: and he is
  mentioned in the two principal poems upon that subject. Yet there were
  writers who placed him eleven generations before the war of Troy,
  consequently ten generations before that expedition. <a

  <p>To remedy the inconsistences, which arise in the history of Orpheus,
  writers have supposed many persons of this name. Suidas takes notice of
  no less than four in <a name="footnotetag1038"
  href="#footnote1038"><sup>[1038]</sup></a>Thrace. But all these will not
  make the history consistent. Vossius therefore, with good reason, doubts
  whether such a person ever existed. Nay, he asserts, <a
  name="footnotetag1039"
  href="#footnote1039"><sup>[1039]</sup></a>Triumviros istos Poeseos,
  Orphea, Musæum, Linum, non fuisse: sed esse nomina ab antiquâ
  Ph&#339;nicum linguâ, quâ usi Cadmus, et aliquamdiu posteri. There is
  great truth in what Vossius here advances: and in respect to Orpheus, the
  testimony of Aristotle, quoted by him from Cicero, is very decisive. <a
  name="footnotetag1040" href="#footnote1040"><sup>[1040]</sup></a>Orpheum
  poetam docet Aristoteles nunquam fuisse. Dionysius, as we learn from
  Suidas, affirmed the same thing. Palæphatus indeed admits the man; but
  sets aside the history. <a name="footnotetag1041"

  is nothing else but a fable</i>. From what has been said, I think it is
  plain, that under the character of this personage we are to understand a
  people named <a name="footnotetag1042"
  href="#footnote1042"><sup>[1042]</sup></a>Orpheans; who, as Vossius
  rightly intimates, were the same as the Cadmians. In consequence of this,
  there will sometimes be found a great similarity between the characters
  of these two persons.</p>

  <p>I have shewn, that Colonies from <a name="footnotetag1043"
  href="#footnote1043"><sup>[1043]</sup></a>Egypt settled in the region of
  Sethon, called afterwards Sethonia, upon the river Palæstinus. They were
  likewise to be found in the countries of Edonia, Pieria, and Peonia: in
  one of which they founded a city and temple. The Grecians called this
  city Orpheus: <a name="footnotetag1044"

  of Thrace, below Pieria</i>. But the place was originally expressed
  Orphi, by which is meant the oracular temple of Orus. From hence, and
  from the worship here instituted, the people were styled Orphites, and
  Orpheans. They were noted for the Cabiritic mysteries; and for the
  Dionusiaca, and worship of Damater. They were likewise very famous for
  the medicinal arts; and for their skill in astronomy and music. But the
  Grecians have comprehended, under the character of one person, the
  history of a people. When they settled in Thrace, they introduced their
  arts, and their worship, among the barbarous <a name="footnotetag1045"
  href="#footnote1045"><sup>[1045]</sup></a>natives, by whom they were
  revered for their superior knowledge. They likewise bequeathed many
  memorials of themselves, and of their forefathers, which were probably
  some emblematical sculptures upon wood or stone: hence we read of the
  tablets of Orpheus preserved in Thrace, and particularly upon mount <a
  name="footnotetag1046" href="#footnote1046"><sup>[1046]</sup></a>Hæmus.
  The temple which they built upon this mountain seems to have been a
  college, and to have consisted of a society of priests. They were much
  addicted to celibacy, as we may judge from their history; and were, in
  great measure, recluses after the mode of Egypt and Canaan. Hence it is
  said of Orpheus, that he secreted himself from the world, and led the
  life of a <a name="footnotetag1047"
  href="#footnote1047"><sup>[1047]</sup></a>Swan: and it is moreover
  mentioned of Aristæus, when he made a visit to Dionusus upon mount Hæmus,
  that he disappeared from the sight of men, and was never after <a
  name="footnotetag1048" href="#footnote1048"><sup>[1048]</sup></a>seen.
  According to the most common accounts concerning the death of Orpheus, it
  was owing to his principles, and manner of life. He was a solitary, and
  refused all commerce with womankind: hence the Mænades, and other women
  of Thrace, rose upon him, and tore him to pieces. It is said, that his
  head, and lyre were thrown into the Hebrus; down which they were wafted
  to Lemnos. What is here mentioned of Orpheus, undoubtedly relates to the
  Orpheans, and to their temple upon mount Hæmus. This temple was in
  process of time ruined: and there is great reason to think, that it was
  demolished upon account of the cruelties practised by the priests, and
  probably from a detestation of their unnatural crimes, to which there are
  frequent allusions. Ovid having given a character of Orpheus, concludes
  with an accusation to this purpose.</p>

  <p>Those of the community, who survived the disaster, fled down the
  Hebrus to Lesbos; where they either found, or erected, a temple similar
  to that which they had quitted. Here the same worship was instituted; and
  the place grew into great reputation. They likewise settled at Lenmos.
  This island lay at no great distance from the former; and was
  particularly devoted to the Deity of fire. It is said by Hecatæus, that
  it received the name of Lemnos from the Magna Dea, Cybele. She was styled
  by the natives <span title="Lêmnos" class="grk"

  temple at Lesbos Orphi, and Orpheï caput: and it appears to have been
  very famous on account of its oracle. Philostratus says, that the
  Ionians, and Æolians, of old universally consulted it: and, what is
  extraordinary, that it was held in high estimation by the people of <a
  name="footnotetag1051"
  href="#footnote1051"><sup>[1051]</sup></a>Babylonia. He calls the place
  the head of Orpheus: and mentions, that the oracle proceeded from a
  cavity in the earth; and that it was consulted by Cyrus, the Persian.
  That the Babylonians had a great veneration for a temple named Orphi, I
  make no doubt: but it certainly could not be the temple at Lesbos. During
  the Babylonish empire, Greece, and its islands, were scarcely known to
  people of that country. And when the Persians succeeded, it is not
  credible, that they should apply to an oracle at Lesbos, or to an oracle
  of Greece. They were too refined in their religious notions to make any
  such application. It is notorious, that, when Cambyses, and Ochus,
  invaded Egypt, and when Xerxes made his inroad into Greece, they burnt
  and ruined the temples in each nation, out of abomination to the worship.
  It was another place of this name, an oracle of their own, to which the
  Babylonians, and Persians, applied. For it cannot be supposed, in the
  times spoken of, that they had a correspondence with the western world.
  It was Ur, in Chaldea, the seat of the antient Magi, which was styled
  Urphi, and Orphi, on account of its being the seat of an oracle. That
  there was such a temple is plain from Stephanus Byzantinus, who tells us,

  an oracle as famous among the people of those parts, as Delphi was among
  the Grecians</i>. This temple was undoubtedly styled Urphi. I do not
  mean, that this was necessarily a proper name; but an appellative, by
  which oracular places were in general distinguished. The city Edessa in
  Mesopotamia seems likewise to have had the name of Urphi, which was given
  on account of the like rites, and worship. That it was so named, we may
  fairly presume from its being by the natives called <a
  name="footnotetag1053" href="#footnote1053"><sup>[1053]</sup></a>Urpha,
  at this day. It was the former temple, to which the Babylonians, and
  Persians had recourse: and it was from the Magi of these parts, that the
  Orphic rites and mysteries were originally derived. They came from
  Babylonia to Egypt, and from thence to Greece. We accordingly find this
  particular in the character of Orpheus, <a name="footnotetag1054"
  href="#footnote1054"><sup>[1054]</sup></a><span title="einai de ton Orphea mageusai deinon" class="grk"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3B9; &#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;

  &#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>, <i>that he was great
  in all the mysteries of the Magi</i>. We moreover learn from Stephanus
  Monachius, that Orphon, a term of the same purport as Orpheus, was one of
  the appellations, by which the Magi were called. <a
  name="footnotetag1055" href="#footnote1055"><sup>[1055]</sup></a>Orphon,
  quod Arabibus Magum sonat. In short, under the character of Orpheus, we
  have the history both of the Deity, and of his votaries. The head of
  Orpheus was said to have been carried to Lemnos, just as the head of
  Osiris used to be wafted to Byblus. He is described as going to the
  shades below, and afterwards returning to upper air. This is similar to
  the history of Osiris, who was supposed to have been in a state of death,
  and after a time to have come to life. There was moreover something
  mysterious in the death of Orpheus; for it seems to have been celebrated
  with the same frantic acts of grief, as people practised in their
  lamentations for Thamuz and Osiris, and at the rites of Baal. The
  Bistonian women, who were the same as the Thyades, and Mænades, used to
  gash their arms with knives, and besmear themselves with <a
  name="footnotetag1056" href="#footnote1056"><sup>[1056]</sup></a>blood,
  and cover their heads with ashes. By this display of sorrow we are to
  understand a religious rite; for Orpheus was a title, under which the
  Deity of the place was worshipped. He was the same as Orus of Egypt, whom
  the Greeks esteemed both as Apollo, and Hephaistus. That he was a deity
  is plain from his temple and oracle abovementioned: which, we find, were
  of great repute, and resorted to by various people from the opposite
  coast.</p>

  <p>As there was an Orpheus in Thrace, so there appears to have been an
  Orpha in <a name="footnotetag1057"
  href="#footnote1057"><sup>[1057]</sup></a>Laconia, of whose history we
  have but few remains. They represent her as a Nymph, the daughter of
  Dion, and greatly beloved by Dionusus. She was said, at the close of her
  life, to have been changed to a tree. The fable probably relates to the
  Dionusiaca, and other Orphic rites, which had been in early times
  introduced into the part of the world abovementioned, where they were
  celebrated at a place called Orpha. But the rites grew into disuse, and
  the history of the place became obsolete: hence Orpha has been converted
  to a nymph, favoured of the God there worshipped; and was afterwards
  supposed to have been changed to one of the trees, which grew within its
  precincts.</p>

  <p>Many undertook to write the history of Orpheus; the principal of whom
  were Zopurus of Heraclea, Prodicus Chius, Epigenes, and Herodorus. They
  seem all to have run into that general mistake of forming a new personage
  from a title, and making the Deity a native, where he was inshrined. The
  writings, which were transmitted under the name of Orpheus, were
  innumerable: and are justly ridiculed by Lucian, both for their quantity,
  and matter. There were however some curious hymns, which used to be of
  old sung in Pieria, and Samothracia; and which Onomacritus copied. They
  contain indeed little more than a list of titles, by which the Deity in
  different places was addressed. But these titles are of great antiquity:
  and though the hymns are transmitted in a modern garb, the person,
  through whom we receive them, being as late as <a name="footnotetag1058"
  href="#footnote1058"><sup>[1058]</sup></a>Pisistratus, yet they deserve
  our notice. They must necessarily be of consequence, as they refer to the
  worship of the first ages, and afford us a great insight into the
  Theology of the antients. Those specimens also, which have been preserved
  by Proclus, in his dissertations upon Plato, afford matter of great
  curiosity. They are all imitations, rather than translations of the
  antient Orphic poetry, accompanied with a short comment. This poetry was
  in the original Amonian language, which grew obsolete among the
  Helladians, and was no longer intelligible: but was for a long time
  preserved in <a name="footnotetag1059"
  href="#footnote1059"><sup>[1059]</sup></a>Samothracia, and used in their
  sacred rites.</p>

<h3>CADMUS.</h3>

  <p>Although I have said so much about Dionusus, Sesostris, and other
  great travellers, I cannot quit the subject till I have taken notice of
  Cadmus: for his expeditions, though not so extensive as some, which I
  have been mentioning, are yet esteemed of great consequence in the
  histories of antient nations. The time of his arrival in Greece is looked
  up to as a fixed æra: and many circumstances in chronology are thereby
  determined. He is commonly reputed to have been a Phenician by birth; the
  son of Agenor, who was the king of that country. He was sent by his
  father's order in quest of his sister Europa; and after wandering about a
  long time to little purpose, he at last settled in Greece. In this
  country were many traditions concerning him; especially in Attica, and
  B&#339;otia. The particular spot, where he is supposed to have taken up
  his residence, was in the latter province at Tanagra upon the river
  Ismenus. He afterwards built Thebes: and wherever he came, he introduced
  the religion of his country. This consisted in the worship of <a
  name="footnotetag1060"
  href="#footnote1060"><sup>[1060]</sup></a>Dionusus; and in the rites,
  which by the later Greeks were termed the Dionusiaca. They seem to have
  been much the same as the Cabyritic mysteries, which he is said to have
  established in Samothracia. He fought with a mighty dragon; whose teeth
  he afterwards sowed, and produced an army of men. To him Greece is
  supposed to have been indebted for the first introduction of <a
  name="footnotetag1061" href="#footnote1061"><sup>[1061]</sup></a>letters;
  which are said to have been the letters of his country Phenicia, and in
  number sixteen. He married Harmonia, the daughter of Mars and Venus: and
  his nuptials were graced with the presence of all the Gods, and
  Goddesses; each of whom conferred some gift upon the bride. He had
  several children; among whom was a daughter Semele, esteemed the mother
  of Bacchus. After having experienced great vicissitudes in life, he is
  said to have retired with his wife Harmonia to the coast of Illyria,
  where they were both changed to serpents. He was succeeded at Thebes by
  his son Polydorus, the father of Labdacus, the father of Laius. This last
  was the husband of Jocasta, by whom he had &#338;dipus.</p>

  <p>Bochart with wonderful ingenuity, and equal learning, tries to solve
  the ænigmas, under which this history is represented. He supposes Cadmus
  to have been a fugitive Canaanite, who fled from the face of Joshua: and
  that he was called Cadmus from being a Cadmonite, which is a family
  mentioned by Moses. In like manner he imagines, that Harmonia had her
  name from mount Hermon, which was probably in the district of the
  Cadmonites. The story of the dragon he deduces from the Hevæi, or
  Hivites; the same people as the Cadmonites. He proceeds afterwards with
  great address to explain the rest of the fable, concerning the teeth of
  the dragon, which were sown; and the armed men, which from thence arose:
  and what he says is in many particulars attended with a great shew of
  probability. Yet after all his ingenious conjectures, I am obliged to
  dissent from him in some points; and particularly in one, which is of the
  greatest moment. I cannot be induced to think, that Cadmus was, as
  Bochart represents him, a Phenician. Indeed I am persuaded, that no such
  person existed. If Cadmus brought letters from Phenicia, how came he to
  bring but sixteen; when the people, from whom he imported them, had
  undoubtedly more, as we may infer from their neighbours? And if they were
  the current letters of Greece, as Herodotus intimates; how came it to
  pass, that the tablet of Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, the third in
  descent from Cadmus, could not be understood, as we are assured by <a
  name="footnotetag1062"
  href="#footnote1062"><sup>[1062]</sup></a>Plutarch? He says, that in the
  reign of Agesilaus of Sparta, a written tablet was found in the tomb of
  Alcmena, to whom it was inscribed: that the characters were obsolete, and
  unintelligible; on which account they sent it to Conuphis of Memphis in
  Egypt, to be decyphered. If these characters were Phenician, why were
  they sent to a priest of a different country for interpretation? and why
  is their date and antiquity defined by the reign of a king in Egypt? <a
  name="footnotetag1063" href="#footnote1063"><sup>[1063]</sup></a><span

  <i>The form of the letters was the same as was in use when Proteus
  reigned in that country.</i> Herodotus, indeed, to prove that the
  Cadmians brought letters into Greece, assures us, that he saw specimens
  of their writing at Thebes, in the temple of Apollo <a
  name="footnotetag1064"
  href="#footnote1064"><sup>[1064]</sup></a>Ismenius: that there was a
  tripod as antient as the reign of Laius, the son of Labdacus; with an
  inscription, which imported, that it had been there dedicated by
  Amphitryon upon his victory over the Teleboæ. I make no doubt, but that
  Herodotus saw tripods with antient inscriptions: and there might be one
  with the name of Amphitryon: but how could he be sure that it was the
  writing of that person, and of those times? We know what a pleasure there
  is in enhancing the antiquity of things; and how often inscriptions are
  forged for that purpose. Is it credible that the characters of Amphitryon
  should be so easy to be apprehended, when those of his wife Alcmena could
  not be understood? and which of the two are we in this case to believe,
  Herodotus or Plutarch? I do not mean that I give any credence to the
  story of Alcmena and her tablet: nor do I believe that there was a tripod
  with characters as antient as Amphitryon. I only argue from the
  principles of the Greeks to prove their inconsistency. The Pheneatæ in
  Arcadia shewed to Pausanias an inscription upon the basis of a brazen
  statue, which was dedicated to <a name="footnotetag1065"
  href="#footnote1065"><sup>[1065]</sup></a>Poseidon Hippius. It was said
  to have been written by Ulysses, and contained a treaty made between him
  and some shepherds. But Pausanias acknowledges that it was an imposition;
  for neither statues of brass, nor statues of any sort, were in use at the
  time alluded to.</p>

  <p>It is said of Cadmus, that he introduced the rites of <a
  name="footnotetag1066" href="#footnote1066"><sup>[1066]</sup></a>Bacchus
  into Greece. But how is this possible, if Bacchus was his descendant, the
  son of his daughter Semele? To remedy this, the latter mythologists
  suppose, that there was a prior Bacchus, who was worshipped by Cadmus.
  This is their usual recourse, when they are hard pressed with
  inconsistencies. They then create other personages, to help them out of
  their difficulties. They form, with great facility, a new Semiramis, or
  Ninus; another Belus, Perseus, Minos, Hermes, Phoroneus, Apis, though to
  little purpose: for the mistake being fundamental, the inconveniencies
  cannot be remedied by such substitutes. We are told that Cadmus was a
  Phenician: but Diodorus Siculus speaks of him as assuredly of Egypt; and
  mentions moreover, that he was a native of the Thebaïs: <a
  name="footnotetag1067" href="#footnote1067"><sup>[1067]</sup></a><span

  Pherecydes Syrus also, from whom most of the mythology of Greece was
  borrowed, makes Cadmus an <a name="footnotetag1068"
  href="#footnote1068"><sup>[1068]</sup></a>Egyptian, the son of Agenor and
  Argiope, who was the daughter of Nilus. By others he is said to have been
  the son of Antiope, the daughter of Belus: consequently he must
  originally have been of Babylonish extraction. His father Agenor, from
  whom he is supposed to have been instructed in the sciences, is
  represented by Nonnus as residing at Thebes.</p>

  <i>Ph&#339;nix and Cadmus came from Thebes in Egypt, and reigned at Tyre
  and Sidon.</i></p>

  <p>Thus I have taken pains to shew, that Cadmus was not, as has been
  generally thought, a Phenician. My next endeavour will be to prove that
  no such person existed. If we consider the whole history of this
  celebrated hero, we shall find, that it was impossible for one person to
  have effected what he is supposed to have performed. His expeditions were
  various and wonderful; and such as in those early times would not have
  been attempted, nor could ever have been completed. The Helladians say
  little more, than that he built Thebes, and brought letters into Greece:
  that he slew a dragon, from the teeth of which being sowed in the ground
  there arose an army of earthborn men. The writers of other countries
  afford us a more extensive account: among the principal of which are to
  be esteemed Herodotus, Diodorus, Strabo, and Pausanias. Some of them had
  their <a name="footnotetag1073"
  href="#footnote1073"><sup>[1073]</sup></a>doubts about the reality of
  this adventurer: and from the history which they have transmitted, we may
  safely infer, that no such person existed, as has been described under
  the character of Cadmus.</p>

  <p>He is said to have sailed first to <a name="footnotetag1074"
  href="#footnote1074"><sup>[1074]</sup></a>Phenicia and Cyprus; and
  afterwards to <a name="footnotetag1075"
  href="#footnote1075"><sup>[1075]</sup></a>Rhodes. Here he instructed the
  people in the religion which he professed; and founded a temple at
  Lindus, where he appointed an order of priests. He did the same <a
  name="footnotetag1076" href="#footnote1076"><sup>[1076]</sup></a>at
  Thera, and afterwards was at <a name="footnotetag1077"
  href="#footnote1077"><sup>[1077]</sup></a>Thasus: and proceeding in his
  travels partook of the Cabiritic mysteries in <a name="footnotetag1078"
  href="#footnote1078"><sup>[1078]</sup></a>Samothracia. He visited <a
  name="footnotetag1079" href="#footnote1079"><sup>[1079]</sup></a>Ionia,
  and all the coast upwards to the Hellespont and Propontis. He was at
  Lesbos, which he named <a name="footnotetag1080"
  href="#footnote1080"><sup>[1080]</sup></a>Issa: where some of his
  posterity were to be found long after. He was also at Anaphe, one of the
  Sporades; which island was denominated Membliaros from one of his <a
  name="footnotetag1081"
  href="#footnote1081"><sup>[1081]</sup></a>followers. Mention is made of
  his being upon the <a name="footnotetag1082"
  href="#footnote1082"><sup>[1082]</sup></a>Hellespont, and in Thrace. Here
  he resided, and found out a mine of <a name="footnotetag1083"

  of copper in <a name="footnotetag1084"

  href="#footnote1087"><sup>[1087]</sup></a>Sparta, as we may infer from
  the Heroüm erected to him by Eurotas, and his brethren, the sons of

  href="#footnote1088"><sup>[1088]</sup></a>Attica; for there were many
  edifices about Athens attributed to him. He settled at Tanagra in
  B&#339;otia; where he lost all his companions, who were slain by a
  dragon. He afterwards built Thebes. Here he was king; and is said to have
  reigned sixty-two <a name="footnotetag1089"
  href="#footnote1089"><sup>[1089]</sup></a>years. But as if his wanderings

  and reside among them at his pleasure: much less that he should build
  temples, found cities, and introduce his religion, wherever he listed;
  and this too in such transient visits. Besides, according to the Egyptian
  accounts, the chief of his adventures were in Libya. He married Harmonia

  <p>Such are the expeditions of Cadmus. But is it credible that any person
  could have penetrated into the various regions, whither he is supposed to
  have gone? to have founded colonies in Phenicia, Cyprus, Rhodes, Thera,
  Thasus, Anaphe, Samothracia? to have twice visited the Hellespont? to
  have worked the mines in the Pangean mountains, and in other places? to
  have made settlements in Eub&#339;a, Attica, B&#339;otia, and Illyria?
  and, above all, to have had such territories in Afric? He is represented
  as heir to the kingdom of Egypt: this he quitted, and obtained a kingdom
  in Phenicia. He leaves this too; and after much wandering arrives in
  Greece; where he founds several cities, and reigns sixty-two years. After
  this, hard to conceive! he is made king in Illyria. He must also have
  reigned in Afric: and his dominions seem to have been considerable, as he
  founded an hundred cities. He is represented as a king in Armenia; and
  had there too no small territory. Sure kingdoms in those times must have
  been very cheap, if they were so easily attainable. But the whole is
  certainly a mistake; at least in respect to <a name="footnotetag1100"
  href="#footnote1100"><sup>[1100]</sup></a>Cadmus. No person could
  possibly have effected what is attributed to him. They were not the
  achievements of one person, nor of one age. And place Cadmus at any given
  æra, and arrange his history, as may appear most plausible; yet there
  will arise numberless inconsistencies from the connexions he must have in
  respect to time, place, and people; such as no art nor disposition can
  remedy.</p>

  <p>It may be asked, if there were no such man as Cadmus, what did the
  antients allude to under this character? and what is the true purport of
  these histories? The travels of Cadmus, like the expeditions of Perseus,
  Sesostris, and Osiris, relate to colonies, which at different times went
  abroad, and were distinguished by this title. But what was the work of
  many, and performed at various seasons, has been attributed to one
  person. Cadmus was one of the names of Osiris, the chief Deity of Egypt.
  Both Europa, and Harmonia are of the like nature. They were titles of the
  Deity: but assumed by colonies, who went out, and settled under these
  denominations. The native Egyptians seldom left their country, but by
  force. This necessity however did occur: for Egypt at times underwent
  great <a name="footnotetag1101"
  href="#footnote1101"><sup>[1101]</sup></a>revolutions. It was likewise in
  some parts inhabited by people of a different cast; particularly by the
  sons of Chus. These were obliged to retire: in consequence of which they
  spread themselves over various parts of the earth. All, who embarked
  under the same name, or title, were in aftertimes supposed to have been
  under the same leader: and to him was attributed the honour of every
  thing performed. And as colonies of the same denomination went to parts
  of the world widely distant; their ideal chieftain, whether Cadmus, or
  Bacchus, or Hercules, was supposed to have traversed the same ground: and
  the achievements of different ages were conferred upon a fancied hero of
  a day. This has been the cause of great inconsistency throughout the
  mythology of the antients. To this they added largely, by being so lavish
  of titles, out of reverence to their gods. Wherever they came they built
  temples to them, and cities, under various denominations; all which were
  taken from some supposed attribute. These titles and attributes, though
  they belonged originally to one God, the Sun; yet being <a
  name="footnotetag1102"
  href="#footnote1102"><sup>[1102]</sup></a>manifold, and misapplied, gave
  rise to a multitude of Deities, whose æra never could be settled, nor
  their history rendered consistent. Cadmus was one of these. He was the
  same as Hermes of Egypt, called also Thoth, Athoth, and Canathoth: and
  was supposed to have been the inventor of letters. He was sometimes
  styled Cadmilus, another name for Hermes; under which he was worshipped
  in Samothracia, and Hetruria. Lycophron speaking of the prophet Prulis,
  in Lesbos, tells us, that he was the son of Cadmus, and of the race of
  Atlas. And he was the person, who was supposed to give information to the
  Greeks, when they were upon their expedition towards Troy.</p>

  Cadmus is said not only to have brought letters into Greece, but to have
  been the inventor of them: from whence we may fairly conclude, that under
  the characters of Hermon, Hermes, Taut, Thoth, and Cadmus, one person is
  alluded to. The Deity called by the Greeks Harmonia, was introduced among
  the Canaanites very early by people from Egypt: and was worshipped in
  Sidon, and the adjacent country, by the name of <a name="footnotetag1115"
  href="#footnote1115"><sup>[1115]</sup></a>Baal Hermon.</p>

  <p>Europa likewise was a Deity; according to Lucian the same as Astarte,
  who was worshipped at Hierapolis in Syria. He visited the temple, and had
  this information from the priests: <a name="footnotetag1116"

  the gods, and particularly the mother of Jupiter.</p>

  <p>Pindar speaks of Europa, as the <a name="footnotetag1118"
  href="#footnote1118"><sup>[1118]</sup></a>daughter of Tityus: and by
  Herodotus she is made the mother of <a name="footnotetag1119"
  href="#footnote1119"><sup>[1119]</sup></a>Sarpedon and Minos.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned, that Cadmus was the same as the Egyptian Thoth; and
  it is manifest from his being Hermes, and from the invention of letters
  being attributed to him. Similar to the account given of Cadmus is the
  history of a personage called by the Greeks Caanthus; this history
  contains an epitome of the voyage undertaken by Cadmus, though with some
  small variation. Caanthus is said to have been the son of Oceanus; which
  in the language of Egypt is the same as the son of Ogus, and Oguges; a
  different name for the same <a name="footnotetag1120"
  href="#footnote1120"><sup>[1120]</sup></a>person. Ogus, and with the
  reduplication Ogugus, was the same as Ogyges, in whose time the flood was
  supposed to have happened. Ogyges is represented both as a king of Thebes
  in Egypt, and of Thebes in B&#339;otia: and in his time Cadmus is said to
  have left the former country, and to have come to the latter, being sent
  in quest of his sister Europa by his father. Caanthus was sent by his
  father with a like commission. His sister Melia had been stolen away; and
  he was ordered to search every country, till he found her. He accordingly
  traversed many seas, and at last lauded in Greece, and passed into
  B&#339;otia. Here he found, that his sister was detained by Apollo in the
  grove of Ismenus. There was a fountain <a name="footnotetag1121"
  href="#footnote1121"><sup>[1121]</sup></a>of the same name near the
  grove, which was guarded by a dragon. Caanthus is said to have cast fire
  into this sacred recess; on which account he was slain by Apollo. His
  <span title="taphos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, or tomb, was in aftertimes
  shewn by the Thebans. We may perceive, that the main part of this
  relation agrees with that of Cadmus. Melie, the sister of Caanthus, is by
  some spoken of as the mother of <a name="footnotetag1122"
  href="#footnote1122"><sup>[1122]</sup></a>Europa: which shews, that there
  is a correspondence between the two histories. The person also, who sent
  these two adventurers, the sister, of whom they went in quest, and the
  precise place, to which they both came, exhibit a series of circumstances
  so similar, that we need not doubt, but that it is one and the same
  history. It is said, that Caanthus threw fire into the sacred <a
  name="footnotetag1123" href="#footnote1123"><sup>[1123]</sup></a>grove:
  which legend, however misconstrued, relates to the first establishment of
  fire-worship at Thebes in the grove of Apollo Ismenius. The term Ismenius
  is compounded of Is-Men, ignis Menis. Meen, Menes, Manes, was one of the
  most antient titles of the Egyptian God Osiris, the same as Apollo, and
  Caanthus. What has been mentioned about Cadmus and Caanthus, is repeated
  under the character of a person named Curnus; who is said to have been
  sent by his father Inachus in search of his sister <a
  name="footnotetag1124" href="#footnote1124"><sup>[1124]</sup></a>Io.
  Inachus, Oceanus, Ogugus, and Agenor, are all the same personages under
  different names; and the histories are all the same.</p>

  <p>That Cadmus was of old esteemed a Deity may be farther proved from his
  being worshipped at Gortyna in Crete, as we learn from <a
  name="footnotetag1125" href="#footnote1125"><sup>[1125]</sup></a>Solinus.
  Iidem Gortynii et Cadmum colunt, Europæ fratrem. He had moreover an
  Heroum at Sparta, which was erected by people styled the sons of <a
  name="footnotetag1126" href="#footnote1126"><sup>[1126]</sup></a>Huræus.
  We learn from Palæphatus, that according to some of the antient
  mythologists, Cadmus was the person, who slew the serpent <a
  name="footnotetag1127" href="#footnote1127"><sup>[1127]</sup></a>at
  Lerna. And according to Nonnus he contended with the giant Typhasus, and
  restored to Jupiter his lost <a name="footnotetag1128"
  href="#footnote1128"><sup>[1128]</sup></a>thunder. By this is meant, that
  he renewed the rites, and worship of the Deity, which had been abolished.
  These are circumstances, which sufficiently shew, that Cadmus was a
  different personage, from what he is generally imagined. There was a hill
  in Phrygia of his name, and probably sacred to him; in which were the
  fountains of the river <a name="footnotetag1129"
  href="#footnote1129"><sup>[1129]</sup></a>Lycus. There was also a river
  Cadmus, which rose in the same mountain, and was lost underground. It
  soon afterwards burst forth again, and joined the principal stream.
  Mountains and rivers were not denominated from ordinary personages. In
  short Cadmus was the same as Hermes, Thoth, and Osiris: under which
  characters more than one person is alluded to, for all theology of the
  antients is of a mixed nature. He may principally be esteemed Ham, who by
  his posterity was looked up to as the Sun, and worshipped under his
  titles: a circumstance, however, which was common to all, who were styled
  Baalim. That he was the same as Ham, will appear from the etymology of
  his name. I have before shewn, that the Sun was styled <a
  name="footnotetag1130" href="#footnote1130"><sup>[1130]</sup></a>Achad,
  Achon, and Achor: and the name, of which we are treating, is a compound
  of <a name="footnotetag1131"
  href="#footnote1131"><sup>[1131]</sup></a>Achad-Ham, rendered by the
  Greeks Acadamus and Academus, and contracted Cadmus. Many learned men
  have thought, that the place at Athens called Academia was founded by
  Cadmus, and denominated from him: and of the latter circumstance I make
  no doubt. <a name="footnotetag1132"
  href="#footnote1132"><sup>[1132]</sup></a>Ab hoc Cadmo Eruditi Academiam,
  quasi Cadmiam deducunt: quo nomine indigitari locum musis studiisque
  sacratum notissimum est. The true name of Cadmus, according to this
  supposition, must have been, as I have represented, Acadamus; or, as the
  Ionians expressed it, Academus, to have Academia formed from it.
  Herodotus informs us, that, when the Cadmians came to Attica, they
  introduced a new system of <a name="footnotetag1133"
  href="#footnote1133"><sup>[1133]</sup></a>Architecture; and built temples
  in a style different from that to which the natives had been used. And he
  describes these buildings as erected at some distance from those of the
  country. This was the situation of the place called Academia, which stood
  at the distance of a few furlongs from <a name="footnotetag1134"
  href="#footnote1134"><sup>[1134]</sup></a>Athens. It was a place of
  exercise and science; and by all accounts finely disposed: being planted
  with a variety of trees, but particularly Olives, called here (<span
  title="Moriai" class="grk"
  >&#x39C;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>) Moriæ. There were
  likewise springs, and baths for the convenience of those who here took
  their exercise. The tradition among the Athenians was, that one Ecademus,
  or Academus, founded it in antient times; from whom it received its name.
  Laërtius styles him the hero Ecademus: <a name="footnotetag1135"

  Hesych. The common notion was, that it was denominated from the hero <a
  name="footnotetag1139" href="#footnote1139"><sup>[1139]</sup></a>Ceramus,
  the son of Dionusus. This arose from the common mistake; by which the
  place was put for the person, to whom it was sacred, and whose name it
  bore. Ham was the supposed hero: and Ceramus was Cer-Ham, the tower or
  temple of Ham, which gave name to the inclosure. This abuse of terms is
  no where more apparent than in an inscription mentioned by Gruter; where
  there is a mixed title of the Deity formed from his place of worship.</p>

  of the serpent Deity: and was undoubtedly built of old by the people
  named Charopians, and Cyclopians; who were no other than the antient
  Cadmians. Ceramicus was an Egyptian name; and one of the gates or towers

  <p>I may possibly be thought to proceed too far in abridging history of
  so many heroic personages, upon whose names antiquity has impressed a
  reverence; and whose mighty actions have never been disputed. For though
  the dress and colouring may have been thought the work of fancy, yet the
  substance of their history has been looked upon as undeniably true. To
  which I answer, that it was undoubtedly founded in truth: and the only
  way to ascertain what is genuine, must be by stripping history of this
  unnatural veil, with which it has been obscured; and to reduce the whole
  to its original appearance. This may be effected upon the principles
  which I have laid down; for if instead of Perseus, or Hercules, we
  substitute bodies of men, who went under such titles, the history will be
  rendered very probable, and consistent. If instead of one person, Cadmus
  traversing so much ground, and introducing the rites of his country at
  Rhodes, Samos, Thera, Thasus, Samothrace, and building so many cities in
  Libya, we suppose these things to have been done by colonies, who were
  styled Cadmians, all will be very right, and the credibility of the
  history not disputed. Many difficulties may by these means be solved,
  which cannot otherwise be explained: and great light will be thrown upon
  the mythology of the antients.</p>

  <p>The story then of Cadmus, and Europa, relates to people from Egypt,
  and Syria, who went abroad at different times, and settled in various
  parts. They are said to have been determined in their place of residence
  by an ox, or cow: by which this only is meant, that they were directed by
  an oracle: for without such previous inquiry no colonies went abroad. An
  oracle by the Amonians was termed Alphi, and Alpha, the voice of God. In
  Egypt the principal oracular temples were those of the sacred animals
  Apis and Mneuis. These animals were highly reverenced at Heliopolis, and
  Memphis, and in other cities of that country. They were of the male kind;
  but the honours were not confined to them; for the cow and heifer were
  held in the like veneration, and they were esteemed equally prophetic.
  Hence it was, that they were in common with the Apis and Mneuis styled
  Alphi, and Alpha: which name was likewise current among the Tyrians, and
  Sidonians. In consequence of this, Plutarch, speaking of the letter
  Alpha, says, <a name="footnotetag1144"
  href="#footnote1144"><sup>[1144]</sup></a><span title="Phoinikas houtô kalein ton Boun." class="grk"
  >&#x3A6;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;

  &#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x392;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;.</span> <i>The

  >&#x391;&#x3BB;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;, &#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;.</span> Thus
  we find that Alpha was both an oracle, and an oracular animal. The
  Grecians took it in the latter acceptation; and instead of saying that
  the Cadmians acted in obedience to an oracle, they gave out, that Cadmus
  followed a cow. What is alluded to in the animal, which was supposed to
  have been his guide, may be known by the description given of it by
  Pausanias: <a name="footnotetag1145"

  <p>Under the character of Europa are to be understood people styled
  Europians from their particular mode of worship. The first variation from
  the purer Zabaism consisted in the Ophiolatria, or worship of the
  serpent. This innovation spread wonderfully; so that the chief Deity of
  the Gentile world was almost universally worshipped under this symbolical
  representation. The serpent among the Amonians was styled Oph, Eph, and
  Ope: by the Greeks expressed <span title="Ophis, Opis, Oupis" class="grk"
  >&#x39F;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;, &#x39F;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;,
  &#x39F;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>: which terms were continually
  combined with the different titles of the Deity. This worship prevailed
  in Babylonia, Egypt, and Syria: from which countries it was brought by
  the Cadmians into Greece. Serpentis eam venerationem acceperunt Græci a
  Cadmo. <a name="footnotetag1151"
  href="#footnote1151"><sup>[1151]</sup></a>Vossius. It made a part in all
  their <a name="footnotetag1152"
  href="#footnote1152"><sup>[1152]</sup></a>mysteries; and was attended
  with some wonderful circumstances: of which I have before made some
  mention in the treatise de Ophiolatriâ. Colonies, which went abroad, not
  only went under the patronage, but under some title of their God: and
  this Deity was in aftertimes supposed to have been the real conductor. As
  the Cadmians, and Europians, were Ophitæ, both their temples, and cities,
  also the hills, and rivers, where they settled, were often denominated
  from this circumstance. We read of Anopus Asopus, Oropus, Europus,
  Charopus, Ellopis, Ellopia; all nearly of the same purport, and named
  from the same object of worship. Europa was a <a name="footnotetag1153"
  href="#footnote1153"><sup>[1153]</sup></a>Deity: and the name is a
  compound Eur-Ope, analogous to Canope, Canophis, and Cnuphis of Egypt;
  and signifies Orus Pytho. It is rendered by the Greeks as a feminine,
  upon a supposition, that it was the name of a woman; but it related
  properly to a country; and we find many places of the like etymology in
  Media, Syria, and Babylonia: which were expressed in the masculine
  Europos, and Oropus. The same also is observable in Greece.</p>

  <p>I have shewn, that Cadmus was Taut, or Thoth; the Taautes of
  Sanchoniathon. It is said of this person, that he first introduced the
  worship of the serpent: and this so early, that not only the Tyrians and
  Sidonians, but the Egyptians received it from him. From hence we may
  infer, that it came from <a name="footnotetag1154"

  <p>The learned writers, who have treated of the Cadmians, have failed in
  nothing more, than in not considering, that they were a twofold colony,
  which came both from Egypt, and Syria: from Egypt first; and then from
  Syria, and Canaan. In their progress westward they settled in Cyprus,
  Crete, Rhodes, Samos, Lesbos, Thrace: also in Eub&#339;a, Attica, and
  B&#339;otia. In process of time they were enabled to make settlements in
  other parts, particularly in Epirus and Illyria: and to occupy some
  considerable provinces in Italy as high up as the Padus. Wherever they
  passed they left behind them numberless memorials: but they are to be
  traced by none more plainly than by their rites, and worship. As they
  occupied the greatest part of Syria, that country was particularly
  addicted to this species of idolatry. Many temples were erected to the
  Ophite God: and many cities were denominated from him. Both <a
  name="footnotetag1156" href="#footnote1156"><sup>[1156]</sup></a>Appian
  and Stephanus Byzantinus mention places in Syrophenicia called Oropus.
  Upon the Euphrates also in Mesopotamia were the cities <a
  name="footnotetag1157"
  href="#footnote1157"><sup>[1157]</sup></a>Amphipolis, and <a
  name="footnotetag1158" href="#footnote1158"><sup>[1158]</sup></a>Dura,
  both called of old Oropus. The chief Syrian God had the title of Bel,
  Baal, and Belial: which last the Greeks rendered <span title="Beliar" class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;</span>. Hence Clemens instead
  of saying, what agreement can there be between Christ and Belial, says <a
  name="footnotetag1159" href="#footnote1159"><sup>[1159]</sup></a><span
  title="Tis de sumphônêsis Christou pros BELIAR" class="grk"
  >&#x3A4;&#x3B9;&#x3C2; &#x3B4;&#x3B5;

  &#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x392;&#x395;&#x39B;&#x399;&#x391;&#x3A1;</span>. This Belial, or
  Beliar, was the same as Belorus, and Osiris, who were worshipped under
  the symbol of a serpent. Hence Hesychius explains the term Beliar by a
  serpent. <span title="Beliar&mdash;drakôn." class="grk"
  >&#x392;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&mdash;&#x3B4;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;.</span>
  <i>Beliar is the same as a dragon or serpent.</i> The Cadmians are said
  to have betaken themselves to Sidon, and Biblus: and the country between
  these cities is called Chous at this day. To the north is the city, and
  province of Hama: and a town, and castle, called by D'Anville Cadmus; by
  the natives expressed Quadamus, or <a name="footnotetag1160"
  href="#footnote1160"><sup>[1160]</sup></a>Chadamus. The Cadmians probably
  founded the temple of Baal Hermon in Mount Libanus, and formed one of the
  Hivite nations in those parts. Bochart has very justly observed, that an
  Hivite is the same as an <a name="footnotetag1161"
  href="#footnote1161"><sup>[1161]</sup></a>Ophite: and many of this
  denomination resided under Mount Libanus, and Anti-Libanus; part of which
  was called Baal Hermon, as we learn from the sacred writings. <a
  name="footnotetag1162" href="#footnote1162"><sup>[1162]</sup></a><i>Now
  these are the nations, which the Lord left to prove Israel, namely, five
  Lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians; and
  the Hivites that dwell in Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon unto the
  entering in of Hamath.</i> There were other Hivites, who are mentioned by
  Moses among the children of <a name="footnotetag1163"
  href="#footnote1163"><sup>[1163]</sup></a>Canaan. But the Cadmonites, and
  many of the people about Mount Libanus were of another family. The
  Hivites of Canaan Proper were those, who by a stratagem obtained a treaty
  with <a name="footnotetag1164"
  href="#footnote1164"><sup>[1164]</sup></a>Joshua. Their chief cities were
  Gibeon, Cephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim. These lay within the the
  tribe of <a name="footnotetag1165"
  href="#footnote1165"><sup>[1165]</sup></a>Judah, and of Benjamin, who
  possessed the southern parts of Canaan. But the other Hivites, among whom
  were the Cadmonites, lay far to the north under Libanus, at the very
  extremities of the country. The sacred writer distinguishes them from the
  Canaanites, as well as from the other Hivites, by saying, the Hivites of
  Baal Hermon. And he seems to distinguish the Sidonians from the genuine
  Canaanites, and justly: for if we may credit prophane history, the
  Cadmians had obtained the sovereignty in that city: and the people were
  of a mixed race. <a name="footnotetag1166"
  href="#footnote1166"><sup>[1166]</sup></a><span title="Kadmos&mdash;Turou kai Sidônos ebasileuen." class="grk"

  The Cadmians extended themselves in these parts quite to the Euphrates,
  and westward to the coast of Greece, and Ausonia; and still farther to
  the great Atlantic. They went under the name of Ellopians, Oropians, <a
  name="footnotetag1167"
  href="#footnote1167"><sup>[1167]</sup></a>Cadmonites, Hermonians, Ophitæ,
  and wherever they settled there will be always found some reference to
  their antient history, and religion. As they were particularly styled
  Ophitæ, or Hivites, many places whither they came, were said to swarm
  with <a name="footnotetag1168"
  href="#footnote1168"><sup>[1168]</sup></a>serpents. Rhodes was under this
  predicament, and had the name of Ophiusa: which name was given on account
  of the Hivites, who there settled, and of the serpent-worship, which they
  introduced. But the common notion was, that it was so called from real
  serpents, with which it was infested. The natives were said to have been
  of the giant race, and the <a name="footnotetag1169"
  href="#footnote1169"><sup>[1169]</sup></a>Heliadæ or offspring of the
  Sun; under which characters the antients particularly referred to the
  sons of Chus, and Canaan. Their coming to the island is alluded to under
  the arrival both of Danaus and Cadmus, by whom the rites, and <a
  name="footnotetag1170" href="#footnote1170"><sup>[1170]</sup></a>religion
  of the Rhodians are supposed to have been introduced. In Greece were
  several cities named Oropus, by which is signified Ori Serpentis civitas.
  One of these was near <a name="footnotetag1171"
  href="#footnote1171"><sup>[1171]</sup></a>Tanagia upon the border of
  Attica, and B&#339;otia. This is the very spot where the Cadmians first
  resided: and the city was undoubtedly built by them. It stood near the
  warm baths of Amphiaraus, whose temple belonged to the Oropians; and who
  was particularly worshipped by them. We are informed by Strabo, that the
  temple of Amphiaraus was built either in imitation, or in memory, of one
  called Cnopia at <a name="footnotetag1172"
  href="#footnote1172"><sup>[1172]</sup></a>Thebes. Cnopia is a contraction
  for Can-Opia; and the temple was certainly founded by people from Egypt.
  It took its name from Can-ope, or Can-opus, the Ophite God of that
  country; and of the people likewise, by whom the building was erected.
  The natives of B&#339;otia had many memorials of their having been
  originally Ophites. The history of their country had continual references
  to serpents and dragons. They seem to have been the national insigne: at
  least they were esteemed so by the people of Thebes. Hence we find, that
  upon the tomb of Epaminondas there was figured a shield with a serpent
  for a device, to signify that he was an Ophite, or <a
  name="footnotetag1173" href="#footnote1173"><sup>[1173]</sup></a>Theban.
  The Spartans were of the same race: and there is said to have been the
  same device upon the shield of <a name="footnotetag1174"
  href="#footnote1174"><sup>[1174]</sup></a>Menelaus, and of <a
  name="footnotetag1175"
  href="#footnote1175"><sup>[1175]</sup></a>Agamemnon. The story of Cadmus,
  and of the serpent, with which he engaged upon his arrival in
  B&#339;otia, relates to the Ophite worship, which was there instituted by
  the Cadmians. So Jason in Colchis, Apollo in Phocis, Hercules at Lerna,
  engaged with serpents, all which are histories of the same purport; but
  mistaken by the later Grecians.</p>

  <p>It will not, I think, be amiss to take notice of some of those
  countries westward, to which Cadmus is said to have betaken himself. From
  B&#339;otia he is supposed to have passed to Epirus and Illyria; and it
  is certain, that the Cadmians settled in many places upon that coast. In
  Thesprotia was a province of the Athamanes; who were denominated from

  Cocytus, the lake Acherusia, and the pestiferous pool <a

  called <a name="footnotetag1178"

  same country, as we are assured by <a name="footnotetag1179"
  href="#footnote1179"><sup>[1179]</sup></a>Herodotus and others. And not
  only colonies from that country, but people from Canaan must have betaken
  themselves to these parts, as is evident from names of places. This will
  appear from the city <a name="footnotetag1180"
  href="#footnote1180"><sup>[1180]</sup></a>Ph&#339;nice: and from another
  near Oricum, called Palæste; and from the coast and region styled

  <p>Here was the haven Comar, or <a name="footnotetag1183"

  and a city <a name="footnotetag1184"
  href="#footnote1184"><sup>[1184]</sup></a>Oropus, similar to the Oropus
  of Syria, and B&#339;otia. And higher up was a region Europa, styled
  Europa Scythica by Festus Rufus. It is observable that there was a city
  in Epirus called <a name="footnotetag1185"
  href="#footnote1185"><sup>[1185]</sup></a>Tecmon, similar to one in
  Canaan, as we may infer from the chief of David's captains being styled
  the <a name="footnotetag1186"
  href="#footnote1186"><sup>[1186]</sup></a>Tecmonite.</p>

  <p>Some of this family proceeded to the western part of the Adriatic
  gulf, and settled upon the Eridanus, or Po. Here were the Orobians, the
  same as the Oropians, whose chief city was Comus: near which the consul
  Marcellus overthrew the <a name="footnotetag1187"
  href="#footnote1187"><sup>[1187]</sup></a>Galli Insubres. The story of
  Phaethon, who was supposed to have fallen into the Eridanus, is
  manifestly of Egyptian original; as the fable of Cycnus is from Canaan.
  Phaethon is by some represented as the first king, who reigned in <a
  name="footnotetag1188" href="#footnote1188"><sup>[1188]</sup></a>Chaonia,
  and Epirus. He was in reality the same as Osiris, the Sun; whose worship
  was in there very early, as well as upon the Padus. The names of the
  Deities in every country are generally prefixed to the list of kings, and
  mistaken accordingly. Cycnus is supposed to have resided not only in
  Liguria, but in Ætolia, and Phocis. There was in these parts a lake <a
  name="footnotetag1189" href="#footnote1189"><sup>[1189]</sup></a>Conope,
  from Cycnus called also <a name="footnotetag1190"
  href="#footnote1190"><sup>[1190]</sup></a>Cycnëa; which names undoubtedly
  came from Egypt, and Canaan. The colonies upon the Padus left many
  memorials of their original; especially those, who were from the
  Caphtorim of Palestina. Some of them had carried on a great work upon the
  part of the river, where they settled; which from them was called <a
  name="footnotetag1191" href="#footnote1191"><sup>[1191]</sup></a>Fossa
  Philistina; and Fossiones Philistinæ. Of this I have made mention <a

  <p>It is said of Cadmus, that at the close of his life, he was, together
  with his wife Harmonia, changed to a serpent of stone. This wonderful
  metamorphosis is supposed to have happened at Encheliæ, a town in
  Illyria, which circumstance is taken notice of by Lucan.</p>

  <p>The true history is this. These two personages were here enshrined in
  a temple, or Petra: and worshipped under the symbol of a serpent. Scylax
  Caryandensis, speaking of this part of Illyria, says, <a

  stones sacred to Cadmus, and Harmonia: and there is likewise a temple
  dedicated to them.</i> Lucan, who calls the place Encheliæ, speaks of the
  name as of great antiquity. It undoubtedly was of long standing, and a
  term from the Amonian language. Encheliæ, <span title="Encheliai" class="grk"
  >&#x395;&#x3B3;&#x3C7;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, is the
  place of En-Chel, by which is signified the fountain of heaven; similar
  to Hanes, Anorus, Anopus in other parts. The temple was an Ophite Petra:
  which terms induced people to believe, that there were in these temples
  serpents petrified. It is possible, that in later times the Deity may
  have been worshipped under this form: whence it might truly be said of
  Cadmus, and Harmonia, that they would one day be exhibited in stone.</p>

  <p>But the notion in general arose from a mistake; and was owing to a
  misinterpretation of the word Petra. On this account many personages were
  said to have undergone this change. Pollux, who was of a character
  superior to what is generally imagined, was said to have been turned to a
  stone.</p>

  <p>Ariadne underwent the like <a name="footnotetag1197"

  name="footnotetag1198" href="#footnote1198"><sup>[1198]</sup></a>Alcmena,
  and others. All these histories relate to personages, enshrined in
  temples styled Petra, who had a <span title="stulos" class="grk"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> or rude pillar erected
  to their honour. This was the usage in all parts, before the introduction
  of images. There are allusions to these Ophite temples, and to these
  pillars, upon the coins of Syria, and Tyre. Upon these the Deity is
  represented between two rough stones, with two <a name="footnotetag1199"
  href="#footnote1199"><sup>[1199]</sup></a>serpents on each side of him. A
  temple of this sort, which betrayed great antiquity, stood in the
  vicinity of Thebes, and was called the serpent's head. Pausanius speaks
  of it as remaining in his <a name="footnotetag1200"
  href="#footnote1200"><sup>[1200]</sup></a>time. The same author affords
  another instance in his account of Achaia; which is attended with some
  remarkable circumstances. He tells us, <a name="footnotetag1201"
  href="#footnote1201"><sup>[1201]</sup></a>that at Pheræ, a city of that
  region, was a fountain sacred to Hermes; and the name of it was Hama.
  Near this fountain were thirty large stones, which had been erected in
  antient times. Each of these was looked upon as a representative of some
  Deity. And Pausanias remarks, that instead of images, the Greeks in times
  of old universally paid their adoration to rude unwrought <a
  name="footnotetag1202"
  href="#footnote1202"><sup>[1202]</sup></a>stones.</p>

  <p>That the Cadmians were the people, whom I suppose them, may I think be
  proved from many other circumstances. There are some particulars in the
  history of these emigrants, by which they may be as effectually
  distinguished, as by any national mark of feature, or complexion. I have
  taken notice in a former treatise of the Cuthites, who came from
  Babylonia and settled in Egypt; and who were afterwards expelled the
  country. They came under different titles; and were styled Phenicians,
  Arabians, and Ethiopians; but they were more particularly distinguished
  by the name of Oritæ, and of shepherds. These appellations must be
  carefully kept in remembrance, for they will be found to occur in almost
  every part of the world, wherever any of this family settled. In the
  histories above given of Osiris, Dionusus, and others, we find, that the
  sons of Chus are represented as great travellers, and at the same time
  general benefactors: and it is to be observed, that the same characters
  occur in every history: the great outlines are the same in all. They
  appear to have been zealous worshippers of the Sun; and addicted to the
  rites of fire: which mode of worship they propagated, wherever they came.
  They are described as of superior stature, and were reputed the sons of
  Anac, and Urius, from Canaan, and Babylonia. In respect to science, they
  seem to have been very eminent, if we consider the times when they lived.
  They were particularly famed for their knowledge in astronomy,
  architecture, and music. They had great sagacity in finding <a
  name="footnotetag1203" href="#footnote1203"><sup>[1203]</sup></a>mines,
  and consequently were very rich. Lastly, there continually occurs in
  their history some allusion to shepherds. Every one of these particulars
  may be met with in the accounts given of the Cadmians: but it was the
  turn of the times to make every thing centre in their imaginary leader,
  Cadmus. He is supposed to have found out mines in Cyprus, and Thrace: and
  to have been the inventor of letters, and the introducer of science. To
  him are ascribed the temples at Rhodes; and the buildings in Attica and
  B&#339;otia. We find him celebrated as a great <a name="footnotetag1204"
  href="#footnote1204"><sup>[1204]</sup></a>theologist and astronomer: and
  it is reported of Cadmus, as it was also of Orpheus, that he left behind
  him many valuable remains, which <a name="footnotetag1205"
  href="#footnote1205"><sup>[1205]</sup></a>Bion Proconnesius is said to
  have translated. But all these gifts, so lavishly bestowed upon one
  person, should be transferred to a people, who went under the name of
  Cadmians: and in whom all these requisites are to be found. If we make
  this allowance, the history will be found to be true. This people, in
  their migrations westward, were accompanied by others from Canaan, and
  Syria. I have shewn that they settled at Rhodes, where they were called
  Ophites, or Hivites. Another of their titles was Heliadæ, or children of
  the <a name="footnotetag1206"
  href="#footnote1206"><sup>[1206]</sup></a>Sun. They were looked upon as
  adepts in every branch of science, and particularly famed for their skill
  in astronomy. They were the first navigators of the seas; and the
  division of time, with the notification of seasons, is ascribed to them.

  were carried by the Oritæ into Egypt: and from Egypt westward to Rhodes,

  Heliadæ, denominated from the great object of their worship, the Sun. He
  was among other titles styled <a name="footnotetag1209"

  Ellopians, Europians, Oropians, Asopians, and the like, being so
  denominated from places which they consecrated to Ops, and Opis, the

  href="#footnote1215"><sup>[1215]</sup></a>Oritæ. This is the express
  title of the shepherds in Egypt; which they assumed both on account of
  the Deity, whom they worshipped, and in reference to the city Ur in
  Chaldea, from whence they were in part derived. They founded a city of
  the same name in Eub&#339;a, which the Greeks expressed <a
  name="footnotetag1216" href="#footnote1216"><sup>[1216]</sup></a>Oria:
  whence came the provincial title of Oritæ. Here Orion was supposed to
  have been <a name="footnotetag1217"
  href="#footnote1217"><sup>[1217]</sup></a>nursed, whose history we know
  was from Babylonia. The natives had a tradition, that he was the son of
  <a name="footnotetag1218"
  href="#footnote1218"><sup>[1218]</sup></a>Urieus, and of the gigantic
  race: the purport of which, I think, cannot be mistaken. They passed, as
  I have shewn, from Eub&#339;a to Attica, and B&#339;otia. Here also was a
  city <a name="footnotetag1219"
  href="#footnote1219"><sup>[1219]</sup></a>Ur, like that in Chaldea, and a
  tradition about Orion being born in these parts. They likewise pretended
  to shew his <a name="footnotetag1220"
  href="#footnote1220"><sup>[1220]</sup></a>tomb. This city Ur, or Uria,
  was in the district of Tanagra, and stood directly opposite to the
  province of Ethiopia in Eub&#339;a, being separated only by the narrow
  frith of the <a name="footnotetag1221"

  Træzen</i>, says Pausanias, <i>give out, that one Orus was the first in
  their country. But the name Orus to me seems to have been of Egyptian
  original. They farther relate, that this Orus was a king, and that the
  province was from him called Oraia.</i> Uria above, and Oraia here,
  however differently expressed, signify literally the land of Ur. In all
  these places the Cuthites went under various appellations, but
  particularly of Cyclopians, Ellopians, and <a name="footnotetag1223"
  href="#footnote1223"><sup>[1223]</sup></a>Europians from their worship.
  Agreeably to the account which has been above given, we find, that the
  Heroum of Cadmus at Sparta was built by Europus, and his brethren: and
  they likewise are represented as the sons of <a name="footnotetag1224"
  href="#footnote1224"><sup>[1224]</sup></a><i>Uræus</i>. As we are
  acquainted with the eastern manner of speaking; and know that by the
  daughter of Tyre, the daughter of Jerusalem, the children of Moab, the
  children of Kedar, the children of Seir, the children of the east, are
  meant the inhabitants of those places: may we not be assured that by
  Europus and the sons of Urius and Uræus, are pointed out a people styled
  Europians of Babylonish extraction, who were ab origine from Ur in
  Chaldea? And is it not plain, that the history of Cadmus is founded upon
  terms ill understood, and greatly misapplied? Yet the truth is not
  totally defaced, as I hope, that I have made appear. By Moses Chorenensis
  Cadmus is represented as of the giant race; and he is said to have come
  from <a name="footnotetag1225"

  planting in Greece a colony of giants.</p>

  <p>Hence the Cadmians were styled <span title="Anakes" class="grk"

  >&#x391;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>,
  Anactoria. These terms were imported from the Anakim of Egypt and Canaan:
  but as the people, who brought them, were Oritæ, and the sons of Urius,
  they must ultimately have come from Babylonia. Here astronomy, and the
  other sciences first commenced; and the worship of the Sun was first
  instituted: where the priests, and professors were styled Oritæ, and <a
  name="footnotetag1228" href="#footnote1228"><sup>[1228]</sup></a>Orchani.
  Lucian indeed says, that astronomy was not derived to the Greeks either
  from the Egyptians, or the Ethiopians; but from <a name="footnotetag1229"
  href="#footnote1229"><sup>[1229]</sup></a>Orpheus. This however
  intimates, that the Ethiopians, under which name the sons of Chus are
  mentioned by the <a name="footnotetag1230"
  href="#footnote1230"><sup>[1230]</sup></a>Greeks, were supposed to have
  introduced science into this country; otherwise this caveat had been
  unnecessary. But we shall in the end shew, that Orpheus was from the same
  quarter. And to put the matter out of all doubt, we find Herodotus
  maintaining very determinately, that the knowledge of the heavens, and
  every thing relating to the distribution of time, was imported from <a
  name="footnotetag1231"
  href="#footnote1231"><sup>[1231]</sup></a>Babylonia. As these
  Babylonians, these sons of Urius, manifestly came to Greece by the way of
  Egypt, it appears pretty evident, that they were the sons of Chus, of the
  shepherd race, who so long held the sovereignty in that kingdom. Hence it
  is, that throughout the whole mythology of the Grecians there are
  continual allusions to shepherds; a title, which we know was peculiar to
  the Auritæ of Egypt. Nonnus, in his allegorical poem, describes Cadmus in
  a pastoral habit, playing upon an instrument, and reclining himself under
  the shade of an oak.</p>

  Homer. That excellent Poet was wonderfully fond of every thing, which
  savoured of antiquity: and has continual references to the antient
  history of Egypt, and to the rites of that country. He sometimes seems to
  adhere superstitiously to obsolete terms, thinking probably, that they
  enriched his verse, and gave a venerable air to the narration. Of these,
  no one occurs more frequently than the title of a shepherd Prince, which
  he bestows on many of his leaders. It is the translation of a title,
  which the sons of Chus, as well as the Egyptians, gave to their Deities,
  and to their kings. Hence the writings of Hermes were inscribed the works
  of the Shepherd Prince, as we may infer from the Greek transcript: for
  that was written in imitation of the former, and called <a

  <i>In respect to the sons of Ham, they seized upon all the inland
  country, which reaches from Syria, and particularly from the mountains
  Albanus, and Libanus: and all the region, which from thence extends
  towards the sea, even as far as the Ocean.</i> Of these emigrants Tacitus
  has given a curious account, which has never been sufficiently heeded. He
  takes notice of those who settled in Canaan, as well as those who passed
  higher towards the north. <a name="footnotetag1259"

  settled about Byblus and Sidon, there seems in consequence of it to have
  been a religious correspondence kept up between this colony and Egypt. It
  is said according to the enigmatical turn of the times, that the head of
  Osiris was annually wafted by the floods to <a name="footnotetag1261"
  href="#footnote1261"><sup>[1261]</sup></a>Byblus. It was reported to have

  voyage truly miraculous. There are many proofs that the religion of Syria
  came in great measure from Egypt. The rites of Adonis, and the
  lamentations upon his account at Sidon, and Byblus, were copies of the
  mourning for Osiris, and represented in the same <a
  name="footnotetag1262" href="#footnote1262"><sup>[1262]</sup></a>manner.
  Lucian, having described the pompous temple at Hierapolis, says, that
  there was another in the neighbourhood, not of Assyrian, but Egyptian
  original; the rites of which were received by the natives from Heliopolis
  in that <a name="footnotetag1263"
  href="#footnote1263"><sup>[1263]</sup></a>country. This he did not see:
  but speaks of it as very grand, and of high antiquity.</p>

  <p>These particulars I have thought proper to discuss thoroughly, in
  order to disclose the true history of the Cadmians, as I am hereby
  enabled to prove the great antiquity of this people; and to shew who they
  were, and from whence they came. It has been observed by many of the
  learned, that some particular race of men spread themselves abroad, and
  got access among numberless nations. Some have thought that they were
  Scythians: others, that they were Egyptians: others still, that they were
  from <ins class="correction" title="repeated word (on 2 lines) in original"
  >Phenicia,</ins> and Canaan. What they have said upon the subject,
  however they may seem to differ from one another, may in some degree be
  allowed. But I believe, that the true account is that which I have here
  given. I have endeavoured, with great pains, to sift the history to the
  bottom: and it is to me manifest, that they were for the most part the
  Auritæ, those shepherds of Egypt. This people had spread themselves over
  that country like a deluge: but were in time forced to retreat, and to
  betake themselves to other parts. In consequence of this they were
  dissipated over regions far remote. They were probably joined by others
  of their family, as well as by the Canaanites, and the Caphtorim of
  Palestina. They are to be met with in Persis, and Gedrosia, under the
  name of Oritæ. They are to be found in B&#339;tica upon the Atlantic
  under the same <a name="footnotetag1264"
  href="#footnote1264"><sup>[1264]</sup></a>name. They settled in Colchis,
  Thrace, Phrygia, Sicily, and Hetruria; and upon the extreme parts of the
  Mediterranean: Diluvio ex illo tot vasta per æquora vecti.</p>

  <p>These are the migrations, of which the antient historian <a
  name="footnotetag1265" href="#footnote1265"><sup>[1265]</sup></a>Istrus
  wrote in a curious treatise, long since lost; which he inscribed <span

  with a summary account of them in Diodorus Siculus, who mentions, that
  after the death of Isis and Osiris the Egyptians sent out many colonies,
  which were scattered over the face of the earth. <a

  Of these migrations there were two remarkable above the rest: the one of
  the sons of Chus, concerning whom I have been treating; the other of the
  Israelites, which was somewhat later than the former. The author above
  takes notice of both these occurrences, in a most valuable extract
  preserved by Photius; wherein he does not sufficiently distinguish the
  particular families of these emigrants, nor the different times of the
  migration: yet the account is very curious; and the history of each
  transaction plainly delineated. <a name="footnotetag1267"

  <p>What I have here said, may in some degree prove a basis for the
  history of Greece. We may indeed talk of Xuthus, Ion, and Hellen: also of
  the Leleges, and Pelasgi, and thus amuse ourselves in the dark: but no
  real emolument can possibly arise, till the cloud, with which history has
  been so long obscured, be done away. This cannot well be effected, till
  some of the first principles, upon which we are to proceed, be made out,
  and these great truths determined.</p>

  <p>This inquisition I have been obliged to make concerning some of the
  principal personages in the annals of Greece. For it is impossible to lay
  a foundation for a future history unless what is true, and what is false,
  be previously determined. All those, of whom I have been treating, stand
  foremost in the lists of antiquity, and have been admitted with too
  little consideration. Many of the first Fathers in the Christian church,
  seeing the high pretensions of the Grecians, tried to invalidate their
  claim, by shewing that all their antient heroes were subsequent to Moses.
  This was the repeated labour of Clemens of Alexandria, Theophilus,
  Eusebius, Tatianus, and others. It was a point urged by them continually
  in their recommendation of the Scriptures, as if priority of time were
  necessarily a mark of truth. The best chronologers likewise admit these
  personages in their computations; and great pains have been used to
  reconcile the contradictions in their histories, and to ascertain the æra
  when they flourished. These learned men acted upon a very laudable
  principle, but failed in the very beginning of their process. For, as I
  have before taken notice, the question should not have been about the
  time when these persons lived, but whether they ever existed. The fathers
  proceeded upon very precarious grounds, and brought their evidence to a
  wrong test. They indeed state things very fairly, and have authorities
  for all that they advance. But the traditions of the Greeks were not
  uniform. And if any Gentile writer, instead of carrying the æra of
  Inachus and Phoroneus, or of Dionusus and Perseus, towards the time of
  Moses, had extended it to the times of the first kings in Egypt, I do not
  see what they could have done; for this person, in his turn, could have
  produced authorities. They might indeed have disputed the point, and have
  opposed evidence to evidence, but nothing certain could have ensued.</p>

  But the daughters of Pr&#339;tus were property the virgins who officiated
  at the Purait, the young priestesses ot the Deity.</p>

  <p>The Sicilian Cyclopes were three, because there were three towers
  only, erected upon the islands called Cyclopum Scopuli; and that they
  were lighthouses is apparent from the name which still remains: for they
  are at this day styled Faraglioni, according to Fazellus. The Cyclopes of
  Tiryns were seven, as we learn from Strabo; because the towers probably
  were in number so many. From this circumstance we may presume, that the
  ideas of the antients concerning the Cyclopians, were taken from the
  buildings which they erected.</p>

  as sacred places had their names from the Deity, to whom they were
  dedicated, it is very probable, that the Cuclopian towers were named from
  C&#339;lus Ops, the Deity there worshipped: for I have shewn, that this
  people were the reputed children of Ouranus and C&#339;lus.</p>

  Egyptians, the emblems of which they made use were arbitrary, and very
  different from the things to which they referred. An eagle, an ox, and a
  horse, were all used as symbols, but had no real connexion with the
  things alluded to, nor any the least likeness. The Grecians not
  considering this were always misled by the type; and never regarded the
  true history, which was veiled under it.</p>

  Menelaus and Agamemnon were antient titles of the chief Deity. The latter
  is supposed to have been the same as Zeus, Æther, and C&#339;lus. He
  seems to have been worshipped under the symbol of a serpent with three
  heads. Hence Homer has given to his hero of this name a serpent for a
  device, both upon his breastplate, and upon his baldrick.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
